<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Madame
Bodichon,
Jan. 1867,
from
Bordeaux.</div>

<p>We prolonged our stay in Paris in order to see Madame
Mohl, who was very good to us; invited the
Scherers and other interesting people to meet us at
dinner on the 29th, and tempted us to stay and breakfast
with her on the 31st, by promising to invite Renan,
which she did successfully, and so procured us a
bit of experience that we were glad to have, over and
above the pleasure of seeing a little more of herself
and M. Mohl. I like them both, and wish there were
a chance of knowing them better. We paid for our
pleasure by being obliged to walk in the rain (from
the impossibility of getting a carriage) all the way
from the Rue de Rivoli&mdash;where a charitable German
printer, who had taken us up in his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiacre</i>, was obliged
to set us down&mdash;to the Hôtel du Helder, through
streets literally jammed with carriages and omnibuses,
carrying people who were doing the severe social
duties of the last day in the year. The rain it raineth
every day, with the exception of yesterday; we can't
travel away from it, apparently. But we start in desperation
for Bayonne in half an hour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Congreve,
16th
Jan. 1867,
from
Biarritz.</div>

<p>Snow on the ground here, too&mdash;more, we are told,
than has been seen here for fifteen years before. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
it has been obliging enough to fall in the night, and
the sky is glorious this morning, as it was yesterday.
Sunday was the one exception since the 6th, when we
arrived here to a state of weather which has allowed
us to be out of doors the greater part of our daylight.
We think it curious that, among the many persons who
have talked to us about Biarritz, the Brownings alone
have ever spoken of its natural beauties; yet these are
transcendent. We agree that the sea never seemed so
magnificent to us before, though we have seen the
Atlantic breaking on the rocks at Ilfracombe and on
the great granite walls of the Scilly Isles. In the
southern division of the bay we see the sun set over
the Pyrenees; and in the northern we have two splendid
stretches of sand, one with huge fragments of dark
rock scattered about for the waves to leap over, the
other an unbroken level, firm to the feet, where the
hindmost line of wave sends up its spray on the horizon
like a suddenly rising cloud. This part of the bay
is worthily called the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambre de l'Amour</span>; and we
have its beauties all to ourselves, which, alas! in this
stage of the world, one can't help feeling to be an advantage.
The few families and bachelors who are here
(chiefly English) scarcely ever come across our path.
The days pass so rapidly, we can hardly believe in
their number when we come to count them. After
breakfast we both read the "Politique"&mdash;George one
volume and I another&mdash;interrupting each other continually
with questions and remarks. That morning
study keeps me in a state of enthusiasm through the
day&mdash;a moral glow, which is a sort of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">milieu subjectif</i>
for the sublime sea and sky. Mr. Lewes is converted
to the warmest admiration of the chapter on language
in the third volume, which about three years ago he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
thought slightly of. I think the first chapter of the
fourth volume is among the finest of all, and the most
finely written. My gratitude increases continually for
the illumination Comte has contributed to my life.
But we both of us study with a sense of having still
much to learn and to understand. About ten or half-past
ten we go out for our morning walk; and then,
while we plunge about in the sand or march along the
cliff, George draws out a book and tries my paces in
Spanish, demanding a quick-as-light translation of
nouns and phrases. Presently I retort upon him, and
prove that it is easier to ask than to answer. We find
this system of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vivâ-voce</i> mutual instruction so successful
that we are disgusted with ourselves for not having
used it before through all our many years of companionship;
and we are making projects for giving new
interest to Regent's Park by pursuing all sorts of studies
in the same way there. We seldom come indoors
till one o'clock, and we turn out again at three, often
remaining to see the sunset. One other thing I have
been reading here which I must tell you of. It is a
series of three papers by Saveney, in the <cite>Revue des
Deux Mondes</cite> of last year, on "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Physique Moderne</span>,"
an excellent summary, giving a glimpse of the great
vista opened in that region. I think you would like
to read them when you are strong enough for that sort
of exertion.</p>

<p>We stayed three days in Paris, and passed our time
very agreeably. The first day we dined with Madame
Mohl, who had kindly invited Professor Scherer and
his wife, Jules Simon, Lomenie, Lavergne, "and others"
to meet us. That was on the Saturday, and she
tempted us to stay the following Monday by saying
she would invite Renan to breakfast with us. Renan's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
appearance is something between the Catholic priest
and the dissenting minister. His manners are very
amiable, his talk pleasant, but not distinguished. We
are entertaining great projects as to our further journeying.
It will be best for you to address <i>Poste Restante</i>,
Barcelona.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Madame Bodichon,
2d Feb.
1867.</div>

<p>Are you astonished to see our whereabouts? We
left Biarritz for San Sebastian, where we stayed three
days; and both there and all our way to Barcelona
our life has been a succession of delights. We have
had perfect weather, blue skies, and a warm sun. We
travelled from San Sebastian to Saragossa, where we
passed two nights; then to Lerida for one night, and
yesterday to Barcelona. You know the scenery from
San Sebastian to Alsasua, through the lower Pyrenees,
because it lies on the way to Burgos and Madrid. At
Alsasua we turned off through Navarre into Aragon,
seeing famous Pampeluna, looking as beautiful as it
did ages ago among the grand hills. At Saragossa
the scene was thoroughly changed; all through Aragon,
as far as we could see, I should think the country
resembles the highlands of Central Spain. There is
the most striking effect of hills, flanking the plain of
Saragossa, I ever saw. They are of palish clay, washed
by the rains into undulating forms, and some slight
herbage upon them makes the shadows of an exquisite
blue.</p>

<p>These hills accompanied us in the distance all the
way through Aragon, the snowy mountains topping
them in the far distance. The land is all pale brown,
the numerous towns and villages just match the land,
and so do the sheepfolds, built of mud or stone. The
herbage is all of an ashy green. Perhaps if I had
been in Africa I should say, as you do, that the country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
reminded me of Africa; as it is, I think of all I
have read about the East. The men who look on
while others work at Saragossa also seem to belong to
the East, with a great striped blanket wrapped grandly
round them, and a kerchief tied about their hair. But
though Aragon was held by the Moors longer than any
part of Northern Spain, the features and skins of the
people seem to me to bear less traces of the mixture
there must have been than one would fairly expect.
Saragossa has a grand character still, in spite of the
stucco with which the people have daubed the beautiful
small brick of which the houses are built. Here
and there one sees a house left undesecrated by stucco;
and all of them have the fluted tiles and the broad
eaves beautifully ornamented. Again, one side of the
old cathedral still shows the exquisite inlaid work which,
in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">façade</i>, has been overlaid hideously. Gradually,
as we left Aragon and entered Catalonia, the face of the
country changed, and we had almost every sort of beauty
in succession; last of all, between Monserrat and
Barcelona, a perfect garden, with the richest red soil&mdash;blossoms
on the plum and cherry trees, aloes thick
in the hedges. At present we are waiting for the Spanish
hardships to begin. Even at Lerida, a place scarcely
at all affected by foreign travellers, we were perfectly
comfortable&mdash;and such sights! The people scattered
on the brown slopes of rough earth round the fortress&mdash;the
women knitting, etc., the men playing at cards,
one wonderful, gaudily dressed group; another of
handsome gypsies. We are actually going by steam-boat
to Alicante, and from Alicante to Malaga. Then
we mean to see Granada, Cordova, and Seville. We
shall only stay here a few days&mdash;if this weather continues.

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Frederic
Harrison,
18th Feb.
1867, from
Granada.</div>

<p>Your kind letter, written on the 5th, reached me
here this morning. I had not heard of the criticism
in the <cite>Edinburgh</cite>. Mr. Lewes read the article, but
did not tell me of the reviewer's legal wisdom, thinking
that it would only vex me to no purpose. However,
I had felt sure that something of that sort must
have appeared in one review article or another. I am
heartily glad and grateful that you have helped justice
in general, as well as justice to me in particular, by
getting the vindication written for the <cite>Pall Mall</cite>. It
was the best possible measure to adopt. Since we
left Barcelona, a fortnight ago, we have seen no English
papers, so that we have been in the dark as to
English news.</p>

<p>Were you not surprised to hear that we had come
so far? The journey from San Sebastian by Saragossa
and Lerida turned out to be so easy and delightful that
we ceased to tremble, and determined to carry out our
project of going by steamer to Alicante and Malaga.
You cannot do better than follow our example; I mean,
so far as coming to Spain is concerned. Believe none
of the fictions that bookmakers get printed about the
horrors of Spanish hotels and cookery, or the hardships
of Spanish travel&mdash;still less about the rudeness
of Spaniards. It is true that we have not yet endured
the long railway journeys through Central Spain, but
wherever we have been hitherto we have found nothing
formidable, even for our rickety bodies.</p>

<p>We came hither from Malaga in the <i>berlina (coupé)</i>
of the diligence, and have assured ourselves that Mr.
Blackburne's description of a supposed hen-roost, overturned
in the Alameda at Malaga, which proved to be
the Granada diligence, is an invention. The vehicle
is comfortable enough, and the road is perfect; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
at the end of it we have found ourselves in one of the
loveliest scenes on earth.</p>

<p>We shall remain here till the 23d, and then go to
Cordova first, to Seville next, and finally to Madrid,
making our way homeward from thence by easy stages.
We expect to be in the smoky haze of London again
soon after the middle of March, if not before.</p>

<p>I wish I could believe that you were all having anything
like the clear skies and warm sun which have
cheered our journeying for the last month. At Alicante
we walked among the palm-trees with their
golden fruit hanging in rich clusters, and felt a more
delightful warmth than that of an English summer.
Last night we walked out and saw the towers of the
Alhambra, the wide Vega, and the snowy mountains,
by the brilliant moonlight. You see, we are getting a
great deal of pleasure, but we are not working, as you
seem charitably to imagine. We tire ourselves, but
only with seeing or going to see unforgetable things.
You will say that we ought to work to better purpose
when we get home. Amen. But just now we read
nothing but Spanish novels&mdash;and not much of those.
We said good-bye to philosophy and science when we
packed up our trunks at Biarritz.</p>

<p>Please keep some friendship warm for us, that we
may not be too much chilled by the English weather
when we get back.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John
Blackwood,
21st
Feb. 1867.</div>

<p>We are both heartily rejoiced that we came to Spain.
It was a great longing of mine, for, three years ago, I
began to interest myself in Spanish history and literature,
and have had a work lying by me, partly written,
the subject of which is connected with Spain. Whether
I shall ever bring it to maturity so as to satisfy myself
sufficiently to print it is a question not settled; but it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
is a work very near my heart. We have had perfect
weather ever since the 27th of January&mdash;magnificent
skies and a summer sun. At Alicante, walking among
the palm-trees, with the bare brown rocks and brown
houses in the background, we fancied ourselves in the
tropics; and a gentleman who travelled with us assured
us that the aspect of the country closely resembled
Aden, on the Red Sea. Here, at Granada, of
course, it is much colder, but the sun shines uninterruptedly;
and in the middle of the day, to stand in the
sunshine against a wall, reminds me of my sensations
at Florence in the beginning of June. The aspect of
Granada as we first approached it was a slight disappointment
to me, but the beauty of its position can
hardly be surpassed. To stand on one of the towers
of the Alhambra and see the sun set behind the dark
mountains of Loja, and send its after-glow on the white
summits of the Sierra Nevada, while the lovely Vega
spreads below, ready to yield all things pleasant to the
eye and good for food, is worth a very long, long journey.
We shall start to-morrow evening for Cordova;
then we shall go to Seville, back to Cordova, and on
to Madrid.</p>

<p>During our short stay in Paris we went a little into
society, and saw, among other people who interested
us, Professor Scherer, of whom you know something.
He charmed me greatly. He is a Genevese, you
know, and does not talk in ready-made epigrams, like
a clever Frenchman, but with well-chosen, moderate
words, intended to express what he really thinks and
feels. He is highly cultivated; and his wife, who was
with him, is an Englishwoman of refined, simple manners.</p>

<p>At Biarritz again, you see, after our long, delightful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
journey, in which we have made a great loop all
round the east and through the centre of Spain. Mr.
Lewes says he thinks he never enjoyed a journey so
much, and you will see him so changed&mdash;so much
plumper and ruddier&mdash;that if pity has entered much
into your regard for him he will be in danger of losing
something by his bodily prosperity. We crowned our
pleasures in Spain with the sight of the pictures in the
Madrid gallery. The skies were as blue at Madrid as
they had been through the previous part of our journeying,
but the air was bitterly cold; and naughty officials
receive money for warming the museum, but
find other uses for the money. I caught a severe cold
the last day of our visit, and, after an uncomfortable
day and night's railway journey, arrived at Biarritz,
only fit for bed and coddling.</p>

<p>We got home on Saturday evening, after as fine a
passage from Calais to Dover as we ever had, even in
summer. Your letter was among the pleasant things
that smiled at me on my return, and helped to reconcile
me to the rather rude transition from summer to
winter which we have made in our journey from Biarritz.
This morning it is snowing hard and the wind is
roaring&mdash;a sufficiently sharp contrast to the hot sun,
the dust, and the mosquitoes of Seville.</p>

<p>We have had a glorious journey. The skies alone,
both night and day, were worth travelling all the way
to see. We went to Cordova and Seville, but we feared
the cold of the central lands in the north, and resisted
the temptation to see Toledo, or anything else than
the Madrid pictures, which are transcendent.

<p>Among the letters awaiting me was one from an
American travelling in Europe, who gives me the history
of a copy of "Felix Holt," which, he says, has
been read by no end of people, and is now on its way
through Ireland, "where he found many friends anxious
but unable to get it." It seems people nowadays
economize in nothing but books. I found also the
letter of a "Conveyancer" in the <cite>Pall Mall</cite>, justifying
the law of "Felix Holt" in answer to the <cite>Edinburgh</cite>
reviewer. I did not know, before I was told of this
letter in reply, that the <cite>Edinburgh</cite> reviewer had found
fault with my law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter

<p>Your letters, with the valuable enclosure of a check
for £2166 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, have come to me this morning, and
I am much obliged to you for your punctual attention.</p>

<p>I long to see a specimen of the cheap edition of the
novels. As to the illustrations, I have adjusted my
hopes so as to save myself from any great shock.
When I remember my own childish happiness in a
frightfully illustrated copy of the "Vicar of Wakefield,"
I can believe that illustration may be a great good
relatively, and that my own present liking has no
weight in the question.</p>

<p>I fancy that the placarding at railway stations is an
effective measure, for Ruskin was never more mistaken
than in asserting that people have no spare time to
observe anything in such places. I am a very poor
reader of advertisements, but even I am forced to get
them unpleasantly by heart at the stations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>It is rather a vexatious kind of tribute when people
write, as my American correspondent did, to tell me
of one paper-covered American copy of "Felix Holt"
brought to Europe and serving for so many readers
that it was in danger of being worn away under their
hands. He, good man, finds it easy "to urge greater
circulation by means of cheap sale," having "found so
many friends in Ireland anxious but unable to obtain
the book." I suppose putting it in a yellow cover
with figures on it, reminding one of the outside of a
show, and charging a shilling for it, is what we are expected
to do for the good of mankind. Even then I
fear it would hardly bear the rivalry of "The Pretty
Milliner," or of "The Horrible Secret."</p>

<p>The work connected with Spain is not a romance.
It is&mdash;prepare your fortitude&mdash;it is&mdash;a poem. I conceived
the plot, and wrote nearly the whole as a drama
in 1864. Mr. Lewes advised me to put it by for a
time and take it up again, with a view to recasting it.
He thinks hopefully of it. I need not tell you that I
am <em>not</em> hopeful, but I am quite sure the subject is fine.
It is not historic, but has merely historic connections.
The plot was wrought out entirely as an incorporation
of my own ideas. Of course, if it is ever finished to
my satisfaction, it is not a work for us to get money
by, but Mr. Lewes urges and insists that it shall be
done. I have also my private projects about an English
novel, but I am afraid of speaking as if I could
depend on myself; at present I am rather dizzy, and
not settled down to home habits of regular occupation.</p>

<p>I understand that the conveyancer who wrote to the
<cite>Pall Mall</cite> is an excellent lawyer in his department,
and the lecturer on Real Property at the Law Institution.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>If a reviewer ever checked himself by considering
that a writer whom he thinks worth praising would
take some pains to know the truth about a matter
which is the very hinge of said writer's story, review
articles would cut a shrunken figure.</p>

<p>Yesterday we went to the second of a course of lectures
which Dr. Congreve is delivering on Positivism
in Bouverie Street. At the first lecture on the 5th
there was a considerable audience&mdash;about seventy-five,
chiefly men&mdash;of various ranks, from lords and M.P.'s
downwards, or upwards, for what is called social
distinction seems to be in a shifting condition just
now. Yesterday the wet weather doubtless helped to
reduce the audience; still it was good. Curiosity brings
some, interest in the subject others, and the rest go with
the wish to express adhesion more or less thorough.</p>

<p>I am afraid you have ceased to care much about
pictures, else I should wish that you could see the
Exhibition of Historical Portraits at Kensington. It
is really worth a little fatigue to see the English of
past generations in their habit as they lived&mdash;especially
when Gainsborough and Sir Joshua are the painters.
But even Sir Godfrey Kneller delights me occasionally
with a finely conceived portrait carefully painted.
There is an unforgetable portrait of Newton by him.

<p>I do sympathize with you most emphatically in the
desire to see women socially elevated&mdash;educated
equally with men, and secured as far as possible,
along with every other breathing creature, from suffering
the exercise of any unrighteous power. That is a
broader ground of sympathy than agreement as to the
amount and kind of result that may be hoped for
from a particular measure. But on this special point
I am far from thinking myself an oracle, and on the
whole I am inclined to hope for much good from the
serious presentation of women's claims before Parliament.
I thought Mill's speech sober and judicious
from his point of view&mdash;Karslake's an abomination.</p>

<p><i>À propos</i> of what you say about Mr. Congreve, I
think you have mistaken his, or rather Comte's, position.
There is no denial of an unknown cause, but
only a denial that such a conception is the proper basis
of a practical religion. It seems to me pre-eminently
desirable that we should learn not to make our
personal comfort a standard of truth.</p>

<p>Again we take flight! To North Germany this
time, and chiefly to Dresden, where we shall be accessible
through the <i>Poste Restante</i>. I am ashamed of
saying anything about our health&mdash;we are both "objects"
for compassion or contempt, according to the
disposition of the subject who may contemplate us.</p>

<p>Mr. Beesley (I think it was he) sent us Dr. Congreve's
pamphlet last night, and I read it aloud to
George. We both felt a cordial satisfaction in it. We
have been a good deal beset by little engagements
with friends and acquaintances lately, and these, with
the preparations for our journey, have been rather too
much for me. Mr. Lewes is acting on the advice of
Sir Henry Holland in giving up zoologizing for the
present, because it obliges him to hang down his head.
That is the reason we go inland, and not to the coast,
as I think I hinted to you that we expected to do.</p>

<p>You are sympathetic enough to be glad to hear that
we have had thoroughly cheerful and satisfactory letters
from both our boys in Natal. They are established in
their purchased farm, and are very happy together in
their work. Impossible for mortals to have less trouble
than we. I should have written to you earlier this
week&mdash;for we start to-morrow&mdash;but that I have been
laid prostrate with crushing headache one half of my
time, and always going out or seeing some one the
other half.</p>

<p>Farewell, dear. Don't write unless you have a real
desire to gossip with me a little about yourself and our
mutual friends. You know I always like to have news
of you, but I shall not think it unkind&mdash;I shall only
think you have other things to do&mdash;if you are silent.</p>

after her scene with Silva, and the following dialogue
between her and Juan. At Dresden I rewrote
the whole scene between her and Zarca.</p>

<blockquote><p>This entry is an interesting one to me, as it fixes
the date of the first acquaintance with my family.
Mr. Herbert Spencer was an old friend of ours,
and in the course of their walk he and Mr. Lewes
happened to pass through Weybridge, where my
mother at that time lived. They came to dinner.
Mr. Lewes, with his wonderful social powers,
charmed all, and they passed a delightful evening.
I was myself in America at the time, where I was
in business as a banker at New York. My eldest
sister had just then published a little volume of
poems,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
which was kindly received by the press. On
the invitation of Mr. Lewes she went shortly afterwards
to see George Eliot, then in the zenith of her
fame; nor did she ever forget the affectionate manner
in which the great author greeted her. This
was the beginning of a close friendship between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
families, which lasted, and increased in intimacy,
to the end. Mr. Spencer, in writing to tell me
that it was he who first made Mr. Lewes acquainted
with George Eliot, adds, "You will perhaps be
struck by the curious coincidence that it was also
by me that Lewes was introduced to your family at
Weybridge and remoter issues entailed."</p></blockquote>

<p>About putting Fedalma in type. There would be
advantages, but also disadvantages; and on these latter
I wish to consult you. I have more than three
thousand lines ready in the order I wish them to stand
in, and it would be good to have them in print to read
them critically. Defects reveal themselves more fully
in type, and emendations might be more conveniently
made on proofs, since I have given up the idea of copying
the MS. as a whole. On the other hand, <em>could</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
<em>the thing be kept private when it had once been in the
printing-office</em>? And I particularly wish not to have it
set afloat, for various reasons. Among others, I want
to keep myself free from all inducements to premature
publication; I mean, publication before I have given
my work as much revision as I can hope to give it
while my mind is still nursing it. Beyond this, delay
would be useless. The theory of laying by poems for
nine years may be a fine one, but it could not answer
for me to apply it. I could no more live through one
of my books a second time than I can live through
last year again. But I like to keep checks on myself,
and not to create external temptations to do what I
should think foolish in another. If you thought it possible
to secure us against the oozing out of proofs and
gossip, the other objections would be less important.
One difficulty is, that in my MS. I have frequently two
readings of the same passage, and, being uncertain
which of them is preferable, I wish them both to stand
for future decision. But perhaps this might be managed
in proof. The length of the poem is at present
uncertain, but I feel so strongly what Mr. Lewes insists
on, namely, the evil of making it too long, that I shall
set it before me as a duty not to make it more than
nine thousand lines, and shall be glad if it turns out a
little shorter.</p>

<p>Will you think over the whole question? I am sure
your mind will supply any prudential considerations
that I may have omitted.</p>

<p>I am vexed by the non-success of the serial edition
of the works. It is not, Heaven knows, that I read
my own books or am puffed up about them, but I have
been of late quite astonished by the strengthening testimonies
that have happened to come to me of people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
who care about every one of my books, and continue
to read them&mdash;especially young men, who are just the
class I care most to influence. But what sort of data
can one safely go upon with regard to the success of
editions?</p>

<p>"Felix Holt" is immensely tempted by your

trees and hedges. Mr. Harrison shed the agreeable
light of his kind eyes on me yesterday for a brief space;
but I hope I was more endurable to my visitors than
to myself, else I think they will not come again. I
object strongly to myself, as a bundle of unpleasant
sensations with a palpitating heart and awkward manners.
Impossible to imagine the large charity I have
for people who detest me. But don't you be one of
them.</p>

<p>I am very glad to hear of your projected visit to

state of delight with the poem, now that he is reading
it with close care. He says he is astonished that he
can't find more faults. He is especially pleased with
the sense of variety it gives; and this testimony is
worth the more because he urged me to put the poem
by (in 1865) on the ground of monotony. He is really
exultant about it now, and after what you have said to

<p>There is a good genius presiding over your gifts&mdash;they
are so felicitous. You always give me something
of which I have felt the want beforehand, and can use
continually. It is eminently so with my pretty mittens;
there was no little appendage I wanted more;
and they are just as warm at the wrist as I could have
wished them to be&mdash;warming, too, as a mark of affection
at a time when all cheering things are doubly welcome.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes came home last night, and you may imagine
that I am glad. Between the bad weather, bad
health, and solitude, I have been so far unlike the
wicked that I have not flourished like the green bay-tree.
To make amends, he&mdash;Mr. Lewes, not the wicked&mdash;has
had a brilliant time, gained great instruction,
and seen some admirable men, who have received him
warmly.</p>

<p>I go out of doors very little, but I shall open the
drawer and look at my mittens on the days when I
don't put them on.</p>

<p>We go to-morrow morning to Torquay for a month,
and I can't bear to go without saying a word of farewell
to you. How sadly little we have seen each other
this winter! It will not be so any more, I hope, will
it?</p>

<p>We are both much in need of the change, for Mr.
Lewes has got rather out of sorts again lately. When
we come back I shall ask you to come and look at us
before the bloom is off. I should like to know how
you all are; but you have been so little inspired for
note-writing lately that I am afraid to ask you to send
me a line to the post-office at Torquay. I really deserve
nothing of my friends at present.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara
Hennell,
22d Mch.

<p>I don't know whether you have ever seen Torquay.
It is pretty, but not comparable to Ilfracombe; and,
like all other easily accessible sea-places, it is sadly
spoiled by wealth and fashion, which leave no secluded
walks, and tattoo all the hills with ugly patterns of
roads and villa gardens. Our selfishness does not
adapt itself well to these on-comings of the millennium.</p>

<p>I am reading about savages and semi-savages, and
think that our religious oracles would do well to study
savage ideas by a method of comparison with their
own. Also, I am studying that semi-savage poem, the
"Iliad." How enviable it is to be a classic. When
a verse in the "Iliad" bears six different meanings,
and nobody knows which is the right, a commentator
finds this equivocalness in itself admirable!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter

Blackwood,
end of
Mch. 1868.</div>

<p>Mr. Lewes quite agrees with you, that it is desirable
to announce the poem. His suggestion is, that it should
be simply announced as "a poem" first, and then a
little later as "The Spanish Gypsy," in order to give
a new detail for observation in the second announcement.
I chose the title, "The Spanish Gypsy," a long
time ago, because it is a little in the fashion of the
elder dramatists, with whom I have perhaps more
cousinship than with recent poets. Fedalma might be
mistaken for an Italian name, which would create a
definite expectation of a mistaken kind, and is, on
other grounds, less to my taste than "The Spanish
Gypsy."</p>

<p>This place is becoming a little London, or London
suburb. Everywhere houses and streets are being
built, and Babbacombe will soon be joined to Torquay.</p>

<p>I almost envy you the excitement of golf, which helps
the fresh air to exhilarate, and gives variety of exercise.
Walking can never be so good as a game&mdash;if
one loves the game. But when a friend of Mr. Lewes's
urges him angrily to play rackets for his health, the
prospect seems dreary.</p>

<p>We are afraid of being entangled in excursion trains,
or crowds of Easter holiday-makers, in Easter week,
and may possibly be driven back next Wednesday.
But we are loath to have our stay so curtailed.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes sends his kind regards, and pities all of
us who are less interested in ganglionic cells. He is
in a state of beatitude about the poem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Congreve,
4th
April, 1868.</div>

<p>We find a few retired walks, and are the less discontented
because the weather is perfect. I hope you
are sharing the delights of sunshine and moonlight.
There are no waves here, as you know; but under such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
skies as we are having, sameness is so beautiful that
we find no fault, and there is a particular hill at Babbacombe
of the richest Spanish red. On the whole,
we are glad we came here, having avoided all trouble
in journeying and settling. But we should not come
again without special call, for in a few years all the
hills will be parts of a London suburb.</p>

<p>How glorious this weather is for the hard workers
who are looking forward to their Easter holiday! But
for ourselves, we are rather afraid of the railway stations
in holiday time. Certainly, we are ill prepared
for what Tennyson calls the "To-be," and it is good
that we shall soon pass from this objective existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Madame
Bodichon,
6th April,
1868.</div>

<p>I think Ruskin has not been encouraged about women
by his many and persistent attempts to teach them.
He seems to have found them wanting in real scientific
interest&mdash;bent on sentimentalizing in everything.</p>

<p>What I should like to be sure of, as a result of higher
education for women&mdash;a result that will come to pass
over my grave&mdash;is their recognition of the great amount
of social unproductive labor which needs to be done
by women, and which is now either not done at all or
done wretchedly. No good can come to women, more
than to any class of male mortals, while each aims at
doing the highest kind of work, which ought rather to
be held in sanctity as what only the few can do well.
I believe, and I want it to be well shown, that a more
thorough education will tend to do away with the
odious vulgarity of our notions about functions and
employment, and to propagate the true gospel, that
the deepest disgrace is to insist on doing work for
which we are unfit&mdash;to do work of any sort badly.
There are many points of this kind that want being
urged, but they do not come well from me.

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Congreve,
17th
April, 1868.</div>

<p>Your letter came just at the right time to greet us.
Thanks for that pretty remembrance. We are glad to
be at home again with our home comforts around us,
though we became deeply in love with Torquay in the
daily heightening of spring beauties, and the glory of
perpetual blue skies. The eight hours' journey (one
hour more than we paid for) was rather disturbing;
and, I think, Mr. Lewes has got more zoological experience
than health from our month's delight&mdash;but a delight
it really has been to us to have perfect quiet with
the red hills, the sunshine, and the sea.</p>

<p>I shall be absorbed for the next fortnight, so that I
cannot allow myself the sort of pleasure you kindly
project for us; and when May begins, I want you to
come and stay a night with us. I shall be ready by
and by for such holiday-making, and you must be good
to me. Will you give Dr. Congreve my thanks for his
pamphlet, which I read at Torquay with great interest?
All protests tell, however slowly and imperceptibly, and
a protest against the doctrine that England is to keep
Ireland under all conditions was what I had wished to
be made. But in this matter he will have much more
important concurrence than mine. I am bearing much
in mind the great task of the translation. When it is
completed we shall be able and glad to do what we
were not able to do in the case of the "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Discours Préliminaire</span>,"
namely, to take our share, if we may, in the
expenses of publication.</p>

<p>I send you by to-day's post the MS. of Book
IV., that it may be at hand whenever there is opportunity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
for getting it into print, and letting me have it
in that form for correction. It is desirable to get as
forward as we can, in case of the Americans asking for
delay after their reception of the sheets&mdash;if they venture
to make any arrangement. I shall send the MS.
of Book V. (the last) as soon as headache will permit,
but that is an uncertain limit. We returned from Torquay
on the 16th, leaving the glorious weather behind
us. We were more in love with the place on a better
acquaintance: the weather, and the spring buds, and
the choirs of birds, made it seem more of a paradise to
us every day.</p>

<p>The poem will be less tragic than I threatened: Mr.
Lewes has prevailed on me to return to my original
conception, and give up the additional development,
which I determined on subsequently. The poem is
rather shorter in consequence. Don't you think that
my artistic deference and pliability deserve that it
should also be better in consequence? I now end it
as I determined to end it when I first conceived the
story.</p>

<p>I send you by to-day's post the conclusion of the
poem in MS., and the eighteen sheets of revise. The
last book is brief, but I may truly use the old epigram&mdash;that
it would have taken less time to make it longer.
It is a great bore that the name of my heroine is
wrongly spelled in all the earlier sheets. It is a fresh
proof of the fallibility of our impressions as to our own
doings, that I would have confidently affirmed the
name to be spelled Fedalma (as it ought to be) in my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
manuscript. Yet I suppose I should have affirmed
falsely, for the <i>i</i> occurs in the slips constantly.</p>

<p>As I shall not see these paged sheets again, will you
charitably assure me that the alterations are safely
made?</p>

<blockquote><p>Among my wife's papers were four or five pages
of MS. headed, "Notes on the Spanish Gypsy and
Tragedy in General." There is no evidence as to
the date at which this fragment was written, and it
seems to have been left unfinished. But there was
evidently some care to preserve it; and as I think
she would not have objected to its presentation, I
give it here exactly as it stands. It completes the
history of the poem.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Notes on
"The
Spanish
Gypsy."</div>

<p>The subject of "The Spanish Gypsy" was originally
suggested to me by a picture which hangs in the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scuola
di' San Rocco</span> at Venice, over the door of the large
Sala containing Tintoretto's frescoes. It is an Annunciation,
said to be by Titian. Of course I had seen
numerous pictures of this subject before; and the subject
had always attracted me. But in this my second
visit to the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scuola di' San Rocco</span>, this small picture of
Titian's, pointed out to me for the first time, brought a
new train of thought. It occurred to me that here was
a great dramatic motive of the same class as those used
by the Greek dramatists, yet specifically differing from
them. A young maiden, believing herself to be on the
eve of the chief event of her life&mdash;marriage&mdash;about to
share in the ordinary lot of womanhood, full of young
hope, has suddenly announced to her that she is chosen
to fulfil a great destiny, entailing a terribly different
experience from that of ordinary womanhood. She is
chosen, not by any momentary arbitrariness, but as a
result of foregoing hereditary conditions: she obeys.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
"Behold the handmaid of the Lord." Here, I thought,
is a subject grander than that of Iphigenia, and it has
never been used. I came home with this in my mind,
meaning to give the motive a clothing in some suitable
set of historical and local conditions. My reflections
brought me nothing that would serve me except that
moment in Spanish history when the struggle with the
Moors was attaining its climax, and when there was
the gypsy race present under such conditions as would
enable me to get my heroine and the hereditary claim
on her among the gypsies. I required the opposition
of race to give the need for renouncing the expectation
of marriage. I could not use the Jews or the Moors,
because the facts of their history were too conspicuously
opposed to the working-out of my catastrophe. Meanwhile
the subject had become more and more pregnant
to me. I saw it might be taken as a symbol of the
part which is played in the general human lot by hereditary
conditions in the largest sense, and of the fact
that what we call duty is entirely made up of such conditions;
for even in cases of just antagonism to the
narrow view of hereditary claims, the whole background
of the particular struggle is made up of our inherited
nature. Suppose for a moment that our conduct at
great epochs was determined entirely by reflection,
without the immediate intervention of feeling, which
supersedes reflection, our determination as to the right
would consist in an adjustment of our individual needs
to the dire necessities of our lot, partly as to our natural
constitution, partly as sharers of life with our fellow-beings.
Tragedy consists in the terrible difficulty of
this adjustment&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The dire strife of poor Humanity's afflicted will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struggling in vain with ruthless destiny."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Looking at individual lots, I seemed to see in each the
same story, wrought out with more or less of tragedy,
and I determined the elements of my drama under the
influence of these ideas.</p>

<p>In order to judge properly of the dramatic structure
it must not be considered first in the light of doctrinal
symbolism, but in the light of a tragedy representing
some grand collision in the human lot. And it must
be judged accordingly. A good tragic subject must
represent a possible, sufficiently probable, not a common,
action; and to be really tragic, it must represent
irreparable collision between the individual and the
general (in differing degrees of generality). It is the
individual with whom we sympathize, and the general
of which we recognize the irresistible power. The
truth of this test will be seen by applying it to the
greatest tragedies. The collision of Greek tragedy is
often that between hereditary, entailed Nemesis and
the peculiar individual lot, awakening our sympathy,
of the particular man or woman whom the Nemesis is
shown to grasp with terrific force. Sometimes, as in
the Oresteia, there is the clashing of two irreconcilable
requirements, two duties, as we should say in these
times. The murder of the father must be avenged by
the murder of the mother, which must again be avenged.
These two tragic relations of the individual and general,
and of two irreconcilable "oughts," may be&mdash;will
be&mdash;seen to be almost always combined. The Greeks
were not taking an artificial, entirely erroneous standpoint
in their art&mdash;a standpoint which disappeared altogether
with their religion and their art. They had
the same essential elements of life presented to them
as we have, and their art symbolized these in grand
schematic forms. The Prometheus represents the ineffectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
struggle to redeem the small and miserable
race of man, against the stronger adverse ordinances
that govern the frame of things with a triumphant
power. Coming to modern tragedies, what is it that
makes Othello a great tragic subject? A story simply
of a jealous husband is elevated into a most pathetic
tragedy by the hereditary conditions of Othello's lot,
which give him a subjective ground for distrust. Faust,
Rigoletto (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Roi s'Amuse</span>), Brutus. It might be a
reasonable ground of objection against the whole structure
of "The Spanish Gypsy" if it were shown that the
action is outrageously improbable&mdash;lying outside all
that can be congruously conceived of human actions.
It is <em>not</em> a reasonable ground of objection that they
would have done better to act otherwise, any more
than it is a reasonable objection against the Iphigenia
that Agamemnon would have done better not to sacrifice
his daughter.</p>

<p>As renunciations coming under the same great class,
take the renunciation of marriage, where marriage cannot
take place without entailing misery on the children.</p>

<p>A tragedy has not to expound why the individual
must give way to the general; it has to show that it is
compelled to give way; the tragedy consisting in the
struggle involved, and often in the entirely calamitous
issue in spite of a grand submission. Silva presents
the tragedy of entire rebellion; Fedalma of a grand
submission, which is rendered vain by the effects of
Silva's rebellion. Zarca, the struggle for a great end,
rendered vain by the surrounding conditions of life.</p>

<p>Now, what is the fact about our individual lots? A
woman, say, finds herself on the earth with an inherited
organization; she may be lame, she may inherit a disease,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
or what is tantamount to a disease; she may be
a negress, or have other marks of race repulsive in the
community where she is born, etc. One may go on
for a long while without reaching the limits of the
commonest inherited misfortunes. It is almost a
mockery to say to such human beings, "Seek your
own happiness." The utmost approach to well-being
that can be made in such a case is through large resignation
and acceptance of the inevitable, with as much
effort to overcome any disadvantage as good sense will
show to be attended with a likelihood of success. Any
one may say, that is the dictate of mere rational reflection.
But calm can, in hardly any human organism,
be attained by rational reflection. Happily, we are
not left to that. Love, pity, constituting sympathy,
and generous joy with regard to the lot of our fellow-men
comes in&mdash;has been growing since the beginning&mdash;enormously
enhanced by wider vision of results, by
an imagination actively interested in the lot of mankind
generally; and these feelings become piety&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
loving, willing submission and heroic Promethean effort
towards high possibilities, which may result from
our individual life.</p>

<p>There is really no moral "sanction" but this inward
impulse. The will of God is the same thing as
the will of other men, compelling us to work and
avoid what they have seen to be harmful to social
existence. Disjoined from any perceived good, the
divine will is simply so much as we have ascertained
of the facts of existence which compel obedience at
our peril. Any other notion comes from the supposition
of arbitrary revelation.</p>

<p>That favorite view, expressed so often in Clough's
poems, of doing duty in blindness as to the result, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
likely to deepen the substitution of egoistic yearnings
for really moral impulses. We cannot be utterly blind
to the results of duty, since that cannot be duty which
is not already judged to be for human good. To say
the contrary is to say that mankind have reached no
inductions as to what is for their good or evil.</p>

<p>The art which leaves the soul in despair is laming
to the soul, and is denounced by the healthy sentiment
of an active community. The consolatory elements
in "The Spanish Gypsy" are derived from two
convictions or sentiments which so conspicuously pervade
it that they may be said to be its very warp, on
which the whole action is woven. These are: (1)
The importance of individual deeds. (2) The all-sufficiency
of the soul's passions in determining sympathetic
action.</p>

<p>In Silva is presented the claim of fidelity to social
pledges. In Fedalma the claim constituted by an
hereditary lot less consciously shared.</p>

<p>With regard to the supremacy of love: if it were a
fact without exception that man or woman never did
renounce the joys of love, there could never have
sprung up a notion that such renunciation could present
itself as a duty. If no parents had ever cared for
their children, how could parental affection have been
reckoned among the elements of life? But what are
the facts in relation to this matter? Will any one say
that faithfulness to the marriage tie has never been regarded
as a duty, in spite of the presence of the profoundest
passion experienced after marriage? Is Guinivere's
conduct the type of duty?</p>


<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Bray,
7th May,
1868.</div>

<p>Yes, I am at rest now&mdash;only a few pages of revise
to look at more. My chief excitement and pleasure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in the work are over: for when I have once written
anything, and it is gone out of my power, I think of
it as little as possible. Next to the doing of the
thing, of course, Mr. Lewes's delight in it is the cream
of all sympathy, though I care enough about the sympathy
of others to be very grateful for any they give
me. Don't you imagine how the people who consider
writing simply as a money-getting profession will despise
me for choosing a work by which I could only
get hundreds, where for a novel I could get thousands?
I cannot help asking you to admire what my
husband is, compared with many possible husbands&mdash;I
mean, in urging me to produce a poem rather than
anything in a worldly sense more profitable. I expect
a good deal of disgust to be felt towards me in many
quarters for doing what was not looked for from me,
and becoming unreadable to many who have hitherto
found me readable and debatable. Religion and
novels every ignorant person feels competent to give
an opinion upon, but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en fait de poésie</i>, a large number
of them "only read Shakespeare." But enough of that.</p>

<p>Before we set off to Germany I want to tell you that
a copy of "The Spanish Gypsy" will be sent to you.
If there had been time before our going away I should
have written on the fly-leaf that it was offered by the
author "in grateful remembrance." For I especially
desire that you should understand my reasons for asking
you to accept the book to be retrospective and not
prospective.</p>

<p>And I am going out of reach of all letters, so that
you are free from any need to write to me, and may
let the book lie till you like to open it.</p>

<p>I give away my books only by exception, and in
venturing to make you an exceptional person in this

<p>Yes, indeed, I not only remember your letter, but
have always kept it at hand, and have read it many
times. Within these latter months I have seemed to
see in the distance a possible poem shaped on your
idea. But it would be better for you to encourage the
growth towards realization in your own mind, rather
than trust to transplantation.</p>

<p>My own faint conception is that of a frankly Utopian
construction, freeing the poet from all local embarrassments.
Great epics have always been more or
less of this character&mdash;only the construction has been
of the past, not of the future.</p>

<p><i>May 26.</i>&mdash;We set out this evening on our journey to
Baden, spending the night at Dover. Our route was
by Tournay, Liége, Bonn, and Frankfort, to Baden,
where we stayed nine days; then to Petersthal, where
we stayed three weeks; then to Freiburg, St. Märgen,
Basle, Thun, and Interlaken. From Interlaken we
came by Fribourg, Neuchâtel, Dijon, to Paris and
Folkestone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John Blackwood,
7th

<p>We got your letter yesterday here among the peaceful
mountain-tops. After ascending gradually (in a
carriage) for nearly four hours, we found ourselves in
a region of grass, corn, and pine woods, so beautifully
varied that we seem to be walking in a great park laid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
out for our special delight. The monks, as usual, found
out the friendly solitude, and this place of St. Märgen
was originally nothing but an Augustinian monastery.
About three miles off is another place of like origin,
called St. Peter's, formerly a Benedictine monastery,
and still used as a place of preparation for the Catholic
priesthood. The monks have all vanished, but the
people are devout Catholics. At every half-mile by
the roadside is a carefully kept crucifix; and last
night, as we were having our supper in the common
room of the inn, we suddenly heard sounds that
seemed to me like those of an accordion. "Is that a
zittern?" said Mr. Lewes to the German lady by his
side. "No&mdash;it is prayer." The servants, by themselves&mdash;the
host and hostess were in the same room
with us&mdash;were saying their evening prayers, men's and
women's voices blending in unusually correct harmony.
The same loud prayer is heard at morning,
noon, and evening, from the shepherds and workers
in the fields. We suppose that the believers in Mr.
Home and in Madame Rachel would pronounce these
people "grossly superstitious." The land is cultivated
by rich peasant proprietors, and the people here, as in
Petersthal, look healthy and contented. This really
adds to one's pleasure in seeing natural beauties.
In North Germany, at Ilmenau, we were constantly
pained by meeting peasants who looked underfed and
miserable. Unhappily, the weather is too cold and
damp, and our accommodations are too scanty, under
such circumstances, for us to remain here and enjoy
the endless walks and the sunsets that would make
up for other negatives in fine, warm weather. We return
to Freiburg to-morrow, and from thence we shall
go on by easy stages through Switzerland, by Thun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and Vevay to Geneva, where I want to see my old
friends once more.</p>

<p>We shall be so constantly on the move that it might
be a vain trouble on your part to shoot another letter
after such flying birds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John

24th
July, 1868.</div>

<p>We got home last night&mdash;sooner than we expected,
because we gave up the round by Geneva, as too long
and exciting. I dare say the three weeks since we
heard from you seem very short to you, passed amid
your usual occupations. To us they seem long, for
we have been constantly changing our scene. Our
two months have been spent delightfully in seeing
fresh natural beauties, and with the occasional cheering
influence of kind people. But I think we were
hardly ever, except in Spain, so long ignorant of home
sayings and doings, for we have been chiefly in regions
innocent even of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Galignani</i>. The weather with us
has never been oppressively hot; and storms or quiet
rains have been frequent. But our bit of burned-up
lawn is significant of the dryness here. I believe I
did not thank you for the offer of "Kinglake," which
we gratefully accept. And will you kindly order a
copy of the poem to be sent to Gerald Massey,
Hemel-Hempstead.</p>

<p>A friendly gentleman at Belfast sends me a list of
emendations for some of my verses, which are very
characteristic and amusing.</p>

<p>I hope you have kept well through the heat. We
are come back in great force, for such feeble wretches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter

<p>As to the reviews, we expected them to be written
by omniscient personages, but we did <em>not</em> expect so
bad a review as that Mr. Lewes found in the <cite>Pall Mall</cite>.
I have read no notice except that in the <cite>Spectator</cite>, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
was modest in tone. A very silly gentleman, Mr. Lewes
says, undertakes to admonish me in the <cite>Westminster</cite>;
and he thinks the best <em>literary</em> notice of the poem that
has come before him is in the <cite>Athenæum</cite>. After all, I
think there would have been good reason to doubt that
the poem had either novelty or any other considerable
intrinsic reason to justify its being written, if the periodicals
had cried out "Hosanna!" I am sure you appreciate
all the conditions better than I can, after your
long experience of the relations between authors and
critics. I am serene, because I only expected the unfavorable.
To-day the heat is so great that it is hardly
possible even to read a book that requires any thought.
London is a bad exchange for the mountains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John
Blackwood,
30th
July, 1868.</div>

<p>I enclose a list of corrections for the reprint. I am
indebted to my friendly correspondent from Belfast for
pointing out several oversights, which I am ashamed
of, after all the proof-reading. But, among the well-established
truths of which I never doubt, the fallibility
of my own brain stands first.</p>

<p>I suppose Mudie and the other librarians will not
part with their copies of the poems quite as soon as they
would part with their more abundant copies of a novel.
And this supposition, if warranted, would be an encouragement
to reprint another moderate edition at
the same price. Perhaps, before a cheaper edition is
prepared, I may add to the corrections, but at present
my mind resists strongly the effort to go back on its
old work.</p>

<p>I think I never mentioned to you that the occasional
use of irregular verses, and especially verses of twelve
syllables, has been a principle with me, and is found
in all the finest writers of blank verse. I mention it
now because, as you have a certain <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">solidarité</i> with my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
poetical doings, I would not have your soul vexed by
the detective wisdom of critics. Do you happen to remember
that saying of Balzac's, "When I want the
world to praise my novels I write a drama; when I
want them to praise my drama I write a novel"?</p>

<p>On the whole, however, I should think I have more
to be grateful for than to grumble at. Mr. Lewes read
me out last night some very generous passages from
the <cite>St. Paul's Magazine</cite>.</p>

train to Ilkley, and from thence took a carriage to
Bolton. The weather had been gray for two days,
but on this evening the sun shone out, and we had a
delightful stroll before dinner, getting our first view
of the Priory. On Thursday we spent the whole day
in rambling through the woods to Barden Tower and
back. Our comfortable little inn was the Red Lion,
and we were tempted to lengthen our stay. But on
Friday morning the sky was threatening, so we started
for Newark, which we had visited in old days on
our expedition to Gainsborough. At Newark we found
our old inn, the Ram, opposite the ruins of the castle,
and then we went for a stroll along the banks of the
Trent, seeing some charming, quiet landscapes.</p>

but it cannot greet you so sweetly as your letter did
me on our arrival from Leeds last night. I think it
gave me a deeper pleasure than any I have had for a
long while. I am very grateful to you for it.</p>

<p>We went to Leeds on Monday, and stayed two days
with Dr. Allbut. Dr. Bridges dined with us one day,
and we had a great deal of delightful chat. But I will
tell you everything when we see you. Let that be soon&mdash;will
you not? We shall be glad of any arrangement
that will give us the pleasure of seeing you, Dr. Congreve,
and Emily, either separately or all together.
Please forgive me if I seem very fussy about your all
coming. I want you to understand that we shall feel
it the greatest kindness in you if you will all choose to
come, and also choose <em>how</em> to come&mdash;either to lunch
or dinner, and either apart or together. I hope to
find that you are much the better for your journey&mdash;better
both in body and soul. One has immense need
of encouragement, but it seems to come more easily
from the dead than from the living.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter

<p>Your letter gave an additional gusto to my tea and
toast this morning. The greater confidence of the
trade in subscribing for the second edition is, on several
grounds, a satisfactory indication; but, as you observe,
we shall be still better pleased to know that the
copies are not slumbering on the counters, but having
an active life in the hands of readers.</p>

<p>I am now going carefully through the poem for the
sake of correction. I have read it through once, and
have at present found some ten or twelve <em>small</em> alterations
to be added to those already made. But I shall
go through it again more than once, for I wish to be able
to put "revised" to the third edition, and to leave nothing
that my conscience is not ready to swear by. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
think it will be desirable for me to see proofs. It is
possible, in many closely consecutive readings, not to
see errors which strike one immediately on taking up
the pages after a good long interval.</p>

<p>We are feeling much obliged for a copy of "Kinglake,"
which I am reading aloud to Mr. Lewes as a
part of our evening's entertainment and edification,
beginning again from the beginning.</p>

<p>This week we have had perfect autumnal days,
though last week, when we were in Yorkshire, we
also thought that the time of outside chills and inside
fires was beginning.</p>

<p>We do not often see a place which is a good foil for
London, but certainly Leeds is in a lower circle of the
great town&mdash;<i>Inferno</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

Bodichon,

<p>I can imagine how delicious your country home has
been under the glorious skies we have been having&mdash;glorious
even in London. Yesterday we had Dr. and
Mrs. Congreve, and went with them to the Zoological
Gardens, and on our return, about 5 o'clock, I could
not help pausing and exclaiming at the exquisite beauty
of the light on Regent's Park, exalting it into something
that the young Turner would have wanted to paint.</p>

<p>We went to Leeds last week&mdash;saw your favorite,
David Cox, and thought of you the while. Certainly
there was nothing finer there in landscape than that
Welsh funeral. Among the figure-painters, Watts and
old Philip are supreme.</p>

<p>We went on from Leeds to Bolton, and spent a day in
wandering through the grand woods on the banks of
the Wharfe. Altogether, our visit to Yorkshire was
extremely agreeable. Our host, Dr. Allbut, is a good,
clever, graceful man, enough to enable one to be cheerful
under the horrible smoke of ugly Leeds; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
fine hospital, which, he says, is admirably fitted for its
purpose, is another mitigation. You would like to see
the tasteful, subdued ornamentation in the rooms which
are to be sick wards. Each physician is accumulating
ornamental objects for his own ward&mdash;chromo-lithographs,
etc.&mdash;such as will soothe sick eyes.</p>

<p>It was quite cold in that northerly region. Your
picture keeps a memory of sunshine on my wall even
on this dark morning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter

<p>I have gone through the poem twice for the sake of
revision, and have a crop of small corrections&mdash;only
in one case extending to the insertion of a new line.
But I wish to see the proof-sheets, so that "Revised
by the Author" may be put in the advertisement and
on the title-page.</p>

<p>Unhappily, my health has been unusually bad since
we returned from abroad, so that the time has been a
good deal wasted on the endurance of <i>malaise</i>; but I
am brooding over many things, and hope that coming
months will not be barren. As to the criticisms, I suppose
that better poets than I have gone through worse
receptions. In spite of my reason and of my low expectations,
I am too susceptible to all discouragement
not to have been depressingly affected by some few
things in the shape of criticism which I have been
obliged to know. Yet I am ashamed of caring about
anything that cannot be taken as strict evidence against
the value of my book. So far as I have been able to
understand, there is a striking disagreement among
the reviewers as to what is best and what is worst;
and the weight of agreement, even on the latter point,
is considerably diminished by the reflection that three
different reviews may be three different phases of the
same gentleman, taking the opportunity of earning as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
many guineas as he can by making easy remarks on
George Eliot. But, as dear Scott's characters say,
"Let that fly stick in the wa'&mdash;when the dirt's dry,
it'll rub out." I shall look at "Doubles and Quits,"
as you recommend. I read the two first numbers of
"Madame Amelia," and thought them promising.</p>

<p>I sympathize with your melancholy at the prospect
of quitting the country; though, compared with London,
beautiful Edinburgh is country. Perhaps some
good, thick mists will come to reconcile you with the
migration.</p>

<p>We have been using the fine autumn days for flights
into Kent between Sundays. The rich woods about
Sevenoaks and Chislehurst are a delight to the eyes,
and the stillness is a rest to every nerve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Journal,

<p>At last I have spirit enough in me to thank you for
your valuable gift, which Emily kindly brought me in

medallion<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
is a possession which I shall always hold
precious, but also because you thought of me among
those whom you would choose to be its owners.</p>

<p>I hope you are able to enjoy some walking in these
sunshiny mornings. We had a long drive round by
Hendon and Finchley yesterday morning, and drank
so much clear air and joy from the sight of trees and
fields that I am quite a new-old creature.</p>

<p>I think you will not be sorry to hear that the "Spanish
Gypsy" is so nearly out of print again that the
publishers are preparing a new, cheaper edition. The

<p>Your pretty letter is irresistible. May we then be

the weather should be very cold or wet on Tuesday
we must renounce or defer our pleasure, because we

objects which I had seen with my father nearly thirty
years before&mdash;the turn of the road at Cromford, the
Arkwrights' house, and the cottages with the stone
floors chalked in patterns. The landscape was still
rich with autumn leaves.</p>

<p>We got home last night after delicious days spent
at Matlock. I was so renovated that my head was

suddenly colder when we were in London, and old uneasy
sensations are revisiting us both to-day.</p>

<p>I wonder whether you will soon want to come to

take shelter with us for the night? The bed is no
softer and no broader; but will you not be tempted by
a new carpet and a new bit of matting for your bath?&mdash;perhaps
there will even be a new fender? If you
want to shop, I will take you in the brougham.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>No oracle would dare to predict what will be our

borders of the White Sea, to escape the fitful fast and
loose, hot and cold, of the London climate.</p>

<p>We enjoyed our journey to the north. It was a
great experience to me to see the stupendous iron-works
at Sheffield; and then, for a variety, we went to
the quiet and beauty of Matlock, and I recognized all
the spots I had carried in my memory for more than
five-and-twenty years. I drove through that region
with my father when I was a young grig&mdash;not very full
of hope about my woman's future. I am one of those
perhaps exceptional people whose early, childish dreams
were much less happy than the real outcome of life.</p>

I bear you in my thoughts without any external reminder.</p>

<p>I suppose we are both getting too old to care about
being wished <em>many</em> happy returns of the day. We
shall be content to wish each other as many more years
as can carry with them some joy and calm satisfaction
in the sense of living. But there is one definite prospect
for you which I may fairly hope for, as I do most
tenderly&mdash;the prospect that this time next year you
will be looking back on your achieved work as a good
seed-sowing. Some sadness there must always be in
saying good-bye to a work which is done with love;
but there may&mdash;I trust there <em>will</em>&mdash;be a compensating
good in feeling that the thing you yearned to do is
gone safely out of reach of casualties that might have
cut it short.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>We have been to Sheffield at the seducing invitation
of a friend, who showed us the miraculous iron-works
there; and afterwards we turned aside to beautiful Matlock,
where I found again the spots, the turns of road,
the rows of stone cottages, the rushing river Derwent,
and the Arkwright mills&mdash;among which I drove with
my father when I was in my teens. We had glorious
weather, and I was quite regenerated by the bracing
air. Our friend Mr. Spencer is growing younger with
the years. He really looks brighter and more enjoying
than he ever did before, since he was in the really
young, happy time of fresh discussion and inquiry.
His is a friendship which wears well, because of his
truthfulness. He always asks with sympathetic interest
how you are going on.</p>

be sure that the good of such work is of a kind that
goes deep into young lives. "Fearfully and wonderfully
made" are words quite unshaken by any theory
as to the making; and I think a great awe in the contemplation
of man's delicate structure, freighted with
terrible destinies, is one of the most important parts
of education. A much-writing acquaintance of ours

<p>I am moved to congratulate you on writing against

just read your "slip" at the breakfast-table. It has
been a source of amazement to me that men acquainted
with practical life can believe in the suppression of
bribery by the ballot, as if bribery in all its Protean
forms could ever disappear by means of a single external
arrangement. They might as well say that our
female vanity would disappear at an order that women
should wear felt hats and cloth dresses. It seems to
me that you have put the main unanswerable arguments
against the ballot with vigorous brevity.</p>

<p>Thanks for letting me know about the meeting. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
shall not be able to join it bodily, but I am glad always
to have the possibility of being with you in

<p><i>Dec. 30.</i>&mdash;I make to-day the last record that I shall
enter of the old year 1868. It has been as rich in
blessings as any preceding year of our double life, and
I enjoy a more and more even cheerfulness and continually
increasing power of dwelling on the good that
is given to me and dismissing the thought of small
evils. The chief event of the year to us has been the
publication and friendly reception by the public of
"The Spanish Gypsy." The greatest happiness (after
our growing love) which has sprung and flowed onward
during the latter part of the year is George's interest
in his psychological inquiries. I have, perhaps,
gained a little higher ground and firmer footing in
some studies, notwithstanding the yearly loss of retentive
power. We have made some new friendships that
cheer us with the sense of new admiration of actual
living beings whom we know in the flesh, and who are
kindly disposed towards us. And we have had no real
trouble. I wish we were not in a minority of our fellow-men!
I desire no added blessing for the coming
year but this&mdash;that I may do some good, lasting work,
and make both my outward and inward habits less imperfect&mdash;that
is, more directly tending to the best uses
of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John
Blackwood,
31st
Dec. 1868.</div>

<p>Many thanks for the check, which I received yesterday
afternoon. Mr. Lewes is eminently satisfied
with the sales; and, indeed, it does appear from authoritative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
testimony that the number sold is unusually
large even for what is called a successful poem.</p>

<p>The cheap edition of the novels is so exceptionally
attractive in print, paper, and binding, for 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, that
I cannot help fretting a little at its not getting a more
rapid sale. The fact rather puzzles me, too, in presence
of the various proofs that the books really are
liked. I suppose there is some mystery of reduced
prices accounting for the abundant presentation of
certain works and series on the bookstalls at the railways,
and the absence of others, else surely those
pretty volumes would have a good chance of being
bought by the travellers whose taste shrinks from the
diabolical red-and-yellow-pictured series. I am sure
you must often be in a state of wonderment as to how
the business of the world gets done so as not to ruin
two thirds of the people concerned in it; for, judging
from the silly propositions and requests sometimes
made to me by bald-headed, experienced men, there
must be a very thin allowance of wisdom to the majority
of their transactions.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes is attracted by the biographical studies
of George the Second's time; but last night, after he
had done reading about Berkeley, I heard him laughing
over "Doubles and Quits." It is agreeable to think
that I have that bit of cheerful reading in store.</p>

<p>Our first snow fell yesterday, and melted immediately.
This morning the sun is warm on me as I write.
The doctors say that the season has been horribly unhealthy,
and that they have been afraid to perform
some operations from the low state of vitality in the
patients, due to the atmospheric conditions. This
looks like very wise writing, and worthy of Molière's
"Médecin."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Lewes joins me in sincere good wishes to Mr.
William Blackwood, as well as yourself, for the coming
year&mdash;wishes for general happiness. The chief,
particular wish would be that we should all in common
look back next Christmas on something achieved in
which we share each other's satisfaction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Hon. Robert
Lytton
(now Lord
Lytton).
No date.
Probably
in 1868.</div>

<p>I am much obliged to you for mentioning, in your
letter to Mr. Lewes, the two cases of inaccuracy (I
fear there may be more) which you remembered in the
"Spanish Gypsy." How I came to write Zincálo instead
of Zíncalo is an instance which may be added to
many sadder examples of that mental infirmity which
makes our senses of little use to us in the presence of
a strong prepossession. As soon as I had conceived
my story with its gypsy element, I tried to learn all I
could about the names by which the gypsies called
themselves, feeling that I should occasionally need a
musical name, remote from the vulgar English associations
which cling to "gypsy." I rejected Gitana, because
I found that the gypsies themselves held the
name to be opprobrious; and Zíncalo&mdash;which, with a
fine capacity for being wrong, I at once got into my
head as Zincálo&mdash;seemed to be, both in sound and
meaning, just what I wanted. Among the books from
which I made notes was "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Pott, die Zigeuner</span>," etc.;
and in these notes I find that I have copied the sign
of the tonic accent in Romanó, while in the very same
sentence I have not copied it in Zíncalo, though a renewed
reference to Pott shows it in the one word as well
as the other. But "my eyes were held"&mdash;by a demon
prepossession&mdash;"so that I should not see it." Behold
the fallibility of the human brain, and especially of
George Eliot's.</p>

<p>I have been questioned about my use of Andalus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
for Andalusia, but I had a sufficient authority for that
in the "Mohammedan Dynasties," translated by Gayangos.</p>

<p>It may interest you, who are familiar with Spanish
literature, to know that after the first sketch of my
book was written I read Cervantes' novel "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">La Gitanélla</span>,"
where the hero turns gypsy for love. The
novel promises well in the earlier part, but falls into
sad commonplace towards the end. I have written
my explanation partly to show how much I value your
kind help towards correcting my error, and partly to
prove that I was not careless, but simply stupid. For
in authorship I hold carelessness to be a mortal sin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Journal,
1869.</div>

<p><i>Jan. 1.</i>&mdash;I have set myself many tasks for the year&mdash;I
wonder how many will be accomplished?&mdash;a novel
called "Middlemarch," a long poem on Timoleon, and
several minor poems.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 23.</i>&mdash;Since I wrote last I have finished a little
poem on old Agatha. But the last week or two I have
been so disturbed in health that no work prospers. I
have made a little way in constructing my new tale;
have been reading a little on philology; have finished
the 24th Book of the "Iliad," the 1st Book of the
"Faery Queene," Clough's poems, and a little about
Etruscan things, in Mrs. Grey and Dennis. Aloud to
G. I have been reading some Italian, Ben Jonson's
"Alchemist" and "Volpone," and Bright's speeches,
which I am still reading, besides the first four cantos
of "Don Juan." But the last two or three days I have
seemed to live under a leaden pressure&mdash;all movement,
mental or bodily, is grievous to me. In the
evening read aloud Bright's fourth speech on India,
and a story in Italian. In the <cite>Spectator</cite> some interesting
facts about loss of memory and "double life." In
the <cite>Revue des Cours</cite>, a lecture by Sir W. Thomson, of
Edinburgh, on the retardation of the earth's motion
round its axis.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 27.</i>&mdash;The last two days I have been writing a
rhymed poem on Boccaccio's story of "Lisa." Aloud
I have read Bright's speeches, and "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">I Promessi Sposi</span>."
To myself I have read Mommsen's "Rome."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Feb. 6.</i>&mdash;We went to the third concert. Madame
Schumann played finely in Mendelssohn's quintet, and
a trio of Beethoven's. As a solo she played the sonata
in D minor. In the evening I read aloud a short
speech of Bright's on Ireland, delivered twenty years
ago, in which he insists that nothing will be a remedy
for the woes of that country unless the Church Establishment
be annulled: after the lapse of twenty years
the measure is going to be adopted. Then I read
aloud a bit of the "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Promessi Sposi</span>," and afterwards
the <cite>Spectator</cite>, in which there is a deservedly high appreciation
of Lowell's poems.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 14.</i>&mdash;Finished the poem from Boccaccio. We
had rather a numerous gathering of friends to-day, and
among the rest came Browning, who talked and quoted
admirably <i>à propos</i> of versification. The Rector of
Lincoln thinks the French have the most perfect system
of versification in these modern times!</p>

<p><i>Feb. 15.</i>&mdash;I prepared and sent off "How Lisa Loved
the King" to Edinburgh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara
Hennell,
15th Feb.
1869.</div>

<p>I have looked back to the verses in Browning's
poem about Elisha, and I find no mystery in them.
The foregoing context for three pages describes that
function of genius which revivifies the past. Man,
says Browning (I am writing from recollection of his
general meaning), cannot create, but he can restore:
the poet gives forth of his own spirit, and reanimates
the forms that lie breathless. His use of Elisha's
story is manifestly symbolical, as his mention of Faust
is&mdash;the illustration which he abandons the moment
before to take up that of the Hebrew seer. I presume
you did not read the context yourself, but only
had the two concluding verses pointed out or quoted
to you by your friends. It is one of the afflictions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
authorship to know that the brains which should be
used in understanding a book are wasted in discussing
the hastiest misconceptions about it; and I am sure
you will sympathize enough in this affliction to set any
one right, when you can, about this quotation from
Browning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Journal,
1869.</div>

<p><i>Feb. 20.</i>&mdash;A glorious concert: Hallé, Joachim, and
Piatti winding up with Schubert's trio.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 21.</i>&mdash;Mr. Deutsch and Mrs. Pattison lunched
with us&mdash;he in farewell before going to the East. A
rather pleasant gathering of friends afterwards.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 24.</i>&mdash;I am reading about plants, and Helmholtz
on music. A new idea of a poem came to me yesterday.</p>

<p><i>March 3.</i>&mdash;We started on our fourth visit to Italy,
viâ France and the Cornice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Congreve,
4th
May, 1869,
from Paris.</div>

<p>I found your letter at Florence on our arrival there
(on the 23d); but until now bodily ease and leisure
enough to write to you have never happened to me in
the same moments. Our long journey since we left
home on the 3d March, seen from a point of view
which, happily, no one shares with me, has been a
history of ailments. In shunning the English March,
we found one quite as disagreeable, without the mitigation
of home comforts; and though we went even
as far as Naples in search of warmth, we never found
it until we settled in Rome, at the beginning of April.
Here we had many days of unbroken sunshine, and
enjoyed what we were never able to enjoy during our
month's stay in 1860&mdash;the many glorious views of the
city and the mountains. The chief novelty to us in
our long route has been the sight of Assisi and Ravenna;
the rest has been a revisiting of scenes already
in our memories; and to most of them we have probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
said our last good-bye. Enough of us and our
travels. The only remarkable thing people can tell
of their doings in these days is that they have stayed
at home.</p>

<p>The <cite>Fortnightly</cite> lay uncut at Mr. Trollope's, and
Mr. Lewes had nothing more pressing to do than to
cut it open at the reply to Professor
Huxley.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
He
presently came to me, and said it was excellent. It
delighted him the more because he had just before, at
Rome, alighted on the <cite>Pall Mall</cite> account of the article,
which falsely represented it as entirely apologetic. At
the first spare moment I plunged into an easy-chair,
and read, with thorough satisfaction in the admirable
temper and the force of the reply. We intend to start
for Calais this evening; and as the rain prevents us
from doing anything agreeable out of doors, I have
nothing to hinder me from sitting, with my knees up
to my chin, and scribbling, now that I am become a
little sounder in head and in body generally than
beautiful Italy allowed me to be. As beautiful as
ever&mdash;more beautiful&mdash;it has looked to me on this
last visit; and it is the fault of my <em>physique</em> if it did
not agree with me. Pray offer my warmest sympathy
to Dr. Congreve in the anxieties of his difficult task.
What hard work it seems to go on living sometimes!
Blessed are the dead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Journal,
1869.</div>

<p><i>May 5.</i>&mdash;We reached home after our nine weeks'
absence. In that time we have been through France
to Marseilles, along the Cornice to Spezia, then to
Pisa, Florence, Naples, Rome, Assisi, Perugia, Florence
again, Ravenna, Bologna, Verona; across the
Brenner Pass to Munich; then to Paris <i>viâ</i> Strasburg.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
In such a journey there was necessarily much interest
both in renewing old memories and recording new;
but I never had such continuous bad health in travelling
as I have had during these nine weeks. On our
arrival at home I found a delightful letter from Mrs.
H. B. Stowe, whom I have never seen, addressing me
as her "dear friend."</p>

<blockquote><p>It was during this journey that I, for the first
time, saw my future wife, at Rome. My eldest sister
had married Mr. W. H. Bullock (now Mr. W.
H. Hall), of Six-Mile-Bottom, Cambridgeshire, and
they were on their wedding journey at Rome when
they happened to meet Mr. and Mrs. Lewes by
chance in the Pamfili Doria Gardens. They saw
a good deal of one another, and when I arrived,
with my mother and another sister, we went by invitation
to call at the Hôtel Minerva, where Mr.
Lewes had found rooms on their first arrival in
Rome. I have a very vivid recollection of George
Eliot sitting on a sofa with my mother by her side,
entirely engrossed with her. Mr. Lewes entertained
my sister and me on the other side of the
room. But I was very anxious to hear also the
conversation on the sofa, as I was better acquainted
with George Eliot's books than with any other
literature. And through the dimness of these fifteen
years, and all that has happened in them, I
still seem to hear, as I first heard them, the low,
earnest, deep, musical tones of her voice; I still
seem to see the fine brows, with the abundant auburn-brown
hair framing them, the long head,
broadening at the back, the gray-blue eyes, constantly
changing in expression, but always with a
very loving, almost deprecating, look at my mother,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the finely-formed, thin, transparent hands, and a
whole <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wesen</i> that seemed in complete harmony
with everything one expected to find in the author
of "Romola." The next day Mr. and Mrs. Lewes
went on to Assisi and we to Naples, and we did
not meet again till the following August at Weybridge.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. H. B.
Stowe, 8th
May, 1869.</div>

<p>I value very highly the warrant to call you friend
which your letter has given me. It lay awaiting me
on our return, the other night, from a nine weeks' absence
in Italy, and it made me almost wish that you
could have a momentary vision of the discouragement&mdash;nay,
paralyzing despondency&mdash;in which many days
of my writing life have been passed, in order that you
might fully understand the good I find in such sympathy
as yours&mdash;in such an assurance as you give me
that my work has been worth doing. But I will not
dwell on any mental sickness of mine. The best joy
your words give me is the sense of that sweet, generous
feeling in you which dictated them, and I shall
always be the richer because you have in this way
made me know you better. I must tell you that my
first glimpse of you as a woman came through a letter
of yours, and charmed me very much. The letter was
addressed to Mrs. Follen; and one morning when I
called on her in London (how many years
ago!<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>)
she
was kind enough to read it to me because it contained
a little history of your life, and a sketch of your domestic
circumstances. I remember thinking that it
was very kind of you to write that long letter in reply
to the inquiries of one who was personally unknown to
you; and looking back with my present experience I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
think it was still kinder than it then appeared. For
at that time you must have been much oppressed with
the immediate results of your fame. I remember, too,
that you wrote of your husband as one who was richer
in Hebrew and Greek than in pounds or shillings;
and as the ardent scholar has always been a character
of peculiar interest to me, I have rarely had your image
in my mind without the accompanying image
(more or less erroneous) of such a scholar by your
side. I shall welcome the fruit of his Goethe studies,
whenever it comes. In the meantime let me assure
you that whoever else gave you that description of my
husband's "History of Philosophy"&mdash;namely, "that it
was to solve and settle all things"&mdash;he himself never
saw it in that light. The work has been greatly altered,
as well as enlarged, in three successive editions;
and his mind is so far from being a captive to
his own written words that he is now engaged in
physiological and psychological researches which are
leading him to issues at variance in some important
respects with the views expressed in some of his published
works. He is one of the few human beings I
have known who will often, in the heat of an argument,
see, and straightway confess, that he is in the
wrong, instead of trying to shift his ground or use any
other device of vanity.</p>

<p>I have good hopes that your fears are groundless as
to the obstacles your new book may find here from its
thorough American character. Most readers who are
likely to be really influenced by writing above the
common order will find that special aspect an added
reason for interest and study, and I dare say you have
long seen, as I am beginning to see with new clearness,
that if a book which has any sort of exquisiteness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
happens also to be a popular, widely circulated
book, its power over the social mind for any good is,
after all, due to its reception by a few appreciative natures,
and is the slow result of radiation from that narrow
circle. I mean, that you can affect a few souls,
and that each of these in turn may affect a few more,
but that no exquisite book tells properly and directly
on a multitude, however largely it may be spread by
type and paper. Witness the things the multitude will
say about it, if one is so unhappy as to be obliged to
hear their sayings. I do not write this cynically, but
in pure sadness and pity. Both travelling abroad, and
staying at home among our English sights and sports,
one must continually feel how slowly the centuries
work towards the moral good of men. And that
thought lies very close to what you say as to your
wonder or conjecture concerning my religious point of
view. I believe that religion, too, has to be modified&mdash;"developed,"
according to the dominant phrase&mdash;and
that a religion more perfect than any yet prevalent
must express less care for personal consolation, and
a more deeply-awing sense of responsibility to man,
springing from sympathy with that which of all things
is most certainly known to us, the difficulty of the human
lot. I do not find my temple in Pantheism,
which, whatever might be its value speculatively,
could not yield a practical religion, since it is an
attempt to look at the universe from the outside of
our relations to it (that universe) as human beings.
As healthy, sane human beings, we must love and
hate&mdash;love what is good for mankind, hate what is
evil for mankind. For years of my youth I dwelt in
dreams of a pantheistic sort, falsely supposing that I
was enlarging my sympathy. But I have travelled far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
away from that time. Letters are necessarily narrow
and fragmentary, and, when one writes on wide subjects,
are liable to create more misunderstanding than
illumination. But I have little anxiety of that kind in
writing to you, dear friend and fellow-laborer, for you
have had longer experience than I as a writer, and
fuller experience as a woman, since you have borne
children and known the mother's history from the beginning.
I trust your quick and long-taught mind as
an interpreter little liable to mistake me.</p>

<p>When you say, "We live in an orange grove and are
planting many more," and when I think that you must
have abundant family love to cheer you, it seems to me
that you must have a paradise about you. But no list of
circumstances will make a paradise. Nevertheless, I
must believe that the joyous, tender humor of your
books clings about your more immediate life, and
makes some of that sunshine for yourself which you
have given to us.</p>

<p>I see the advertisement of "Old Town Folk," and
shall eagerly expect it.</p>

<p>That and every other new link between us will be
reverentially valued.</p>

<p><i>May 8</i> (Saturday).&mdash;Poor Thornie arrived from Natal,
sadly wasted by suffering.</p>

<p><i>May 24.</i>&mdash;Sold "Agatha" to Fields &amp; Osgood, for
the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite>, for £300.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Congreve,
26th
May, 1869.</div>

<p>That "disturbance" in my favorite work, with which
you and Dr. Congreve are good enough to sympathize,
is unhappily greater now than it has been for years before.
Our poor Thornie came back to us about seventeen
days ago. We can never rejoice enough that we
were already at home, seeing that we held it impossible
for him to set out on his voyage until at least six weeks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
later than he did. Since he arrived our lives have
been chiefly absorbed by cares for him; and though
we now have a nurse to attend on him constantly, we
spend several hours of the day by his side. There is
joy in the midst of our trouble, from the tenderness towards
the sufferer being altogether unchecked by anything
unlovable in him. Thornie's disposition seems
to have become sweeter than ever with the added six
years; and there is nothing that we discern in his
character or habits to cause us grief. Enough of our
troubles. I gather from your welcome letter, received
this morning, that there is a good deal of enjoyment
for you in your temporary home, in spite of bad weather

<p>Mr. Beesley<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
wrote to me to tell me of his engagement,
and on Sunday we had the pleasure of shaking
him by the hand and seeing him look very happy.
His is one of a group of prospective marriages which
we have had announced to us since we came home.
Besides Mr. Harrison's, there is Dr. Allbut's, our
charming friend at Leeds. I told Mr. Beesley that I
thought myself magnanimous in really rejoicing at the
engagements of men friends, because, of course, they
will be comparatively indifferent to their old intimates.</p>

<p>Dear Madame Bodichon is a precious help to us.
She comes twice a week to sit with Thornie, and she
is wonderfully clever in talking to young people. One
finds out those who have real practical sympathy in
times of trouble.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>Your letter has fulfilled two wishes of mine. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
shows me that you keep me in your kind thoughts, and
that you are very happy. I had been told by our
friends, the Nortons, of your engagement, but I knew
nothing more than that bare fact, and your letter gives
me more of a picture. A very pretty picture&mdash;for I
like to think of your love having grown imperceptibly
along with sweet family affections. I do heartily share
in your happiness, for however space and time may
keep us asunder, you will never to my mind be lost in
the distance, but will hold a place of marked and
valued interest quite apart from those more public
hopes about you which I shall not cease to cherish.</p>

<p>Both Mr. Lewes and I shall be delighted to see you
any evening. I imagine that when you are obliged to
stay in town the evening will be the easiest time for
you to get out to us. Any time after eight you will
find us thoroughly glad to shake hands with you. Do
come when you can.</p>

<p><i>July 3.</i>&mdash;Finished my reading in Lucretius. Reading
Victor Hugo's "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'homme qui rit</span>;" also the Frau
von Hillern's novel, "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ein Arzt der Seele</span>." This week
G. and I have been to Sevenoaks, but were driven
home again by the cold winds and cloudy skies.
"Sonnets on Childhood"&mdash;five&mdash;finished.</p>

<p><i>July 10.</i>&mdash;I wrote to Mrs. Stowe, in answer to a
second letter of hers, accompanied by one from her
husband.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. H. B.
Stowe, 11th
July, 1869.</div>

<p>I hoped before this to have seen our friend, Mrs.
Fields, on her return from Scotland, and to have begged
her to send you word of a domestic affliction which has
prevented me from writing to you since I received your
and your husband's valued letters. Immediately on our
return from Italy, Mr. Lewes's second son, a fine young
man of five-and-twenty, returned to us from Natal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
wasted by suffering from a long-standing spinal injury.
This was on the 8th of May, and since then we
have both been absorbed in our duties to this poor
child, and have felt our own health and nervous energy
insufficient for our needful activity of body and mind.
He is at present no better, and we look forward to a
long trial. Nothing but a trouble so great as this would
have prevented me from writing again to you, not only
to thank you and Professor Stowe for your letters, but
also to tell you that I have received and read "Old
Town Folks." I think few of your many readers can
have felt more interest than I have felt in that picture of
an elder generation; for my interest in it has a double
root&mdash;one, in my own love for our old-fashioned provincial
life, which had its affinities with a contemporary
life, even all across the Atlantic, and of which I have
gathered glimpses in different phases, from my father
and mother, with their relations; the other is, my experimental
acquaintance with some shades of Calvinistic
orthodoxy. I think your way of presenting the
religious convictions which are not your own, except
by indirect fellowship, is a triumph of insight and true
tolerance. A thorough comprehension of the mixed
moral influence shed on society by dogmatic systems
is rare even among writers, and one misses it altogether
in English drawing-room talk. I thank you
sincerely for the gift (in every sense) of this book,
which, I can see, has been a labor of love.</p>

<p>Both Mr. Lewes and I are deeply interested in the
indications which the Professor gives of his peculiar
psychological experience, and we should feel it a great
privilege to learn much more of it from his lips. It is
a rare thing to have such an opportunity of studying
exceptional experience in the testimony of a truthful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and in every way distinguished mind. He will, I am
sure, accept the brief thanks which I can give in this
letter, for all that he has generously written to me.
He says, "I have had no connection with any of the
modern movements, except as father confessor;" and
I can well believe that he must be peculiarly sensitive
to the repulsive aspects which those movements present.
Your view as to the cause of that "great wave
of spiritualism" which is rushing over America&mdash;namely,
that it is a sort of Rachel-cry of bereavement towards
the invisible existence of the loved ones, is
deeply affecting. But so far as "spiritualism" (by
which I mean, of course, spirit-communication, by rapping,
guidance of the pencil, etc.) has come within
reach of my judgment on our side of the water, it has
appeared to me either as degrading folly, imbecile in
the estimate of evidence, or else as impudent imposture.
So far as my observation and experience have
hitherto gone, it has even seemed to me an impiety to
withdraw from the more assured methods of studying
the open secret of the universe any large amount of
attention to alleged manifestations which are so defiled
by low adventurers and their palpable trickeries, so
hopelessly involved in all the doubtfulness of individual
testimonies as to phenomena witnessed, which testimonies
are no more true objectively because they are
honest subjectively, than the Ptolemaic system is true
because it seemed to Tycho Brahé a better explanation
of the heavenly movements than the Copernican. This
is a brief statement of my position on the subject,
which your letter shows me to have an aspect much
more compulsory on serious attention in America than
I can perceive it to have in England. I should not
be as simply truthful as my deep respect for you demands,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
if I did not tell you exactly what is my mental
attitude in relation to the phenomena in question. But
whatever you print on the subject and will send me I
shall read with attention, and the idea you give me of
the hold which spiritualism has gained on the public
mind in the United States is already a fact of historic
importance.</p>

<p>Forgive me, dear friend, if I write in the scantiest
manner, unworthily responding to letters which have
touched me profoundly. You have known so much of
life, both in its more external trials and in the peculiar
struggles of a nature which is made twofold in its demands
by the yearnings of the author as well as of the
woman, that I can count on your indulgence and power
of understanding my present inability to correspond by
letter.</p>

<p>May I add my kind remembrances to your daughter
to the high regard which I offer to your husband?</p>

<p><i>July 14.</i>&mdash;Returned from Hatfield, after two days'
stay.</p>

<p><i>July 15.</i>&mdash;Began Nisard's "History of French Literature"&mdash;Villehardouin,
Joinville, Froissart, Christine
de Pisan, Philippe de Comines, Villers.</p>

<p><i>July 16.</i>&mdash;Read the articles Ph&oelig;nicia and Carthage
in "Ancient Geography." Looked into Jewitt's "Universal
History" again for Carthaginian religion.
Looked into Sismondi's "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Littérature du Midi</span>" for
Roman de la Rose; and ran through the first chapter
about the formation of the Romance languages. Read
about <i>Thallogens</i> and <i>Acrogens</i> in the "Vegetable
World." Read Drayton's "Nymphidia"&mdash;a charming
poem&mdash;a few pages of his "Polyolbion." Re-read
Grote, v.-vii., on Sicilian affairs, down to rise of Dionysius.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p><i>July 18.</i>&mdash;Miss Nannie Smith came, after a long
absence from England; Professor Masson and Dr.
Bastian, Madame Bodichon, and Dr. Payne. Some
conversation about Saint-Simonism, <i>à propos</i> of the
meeting on Woman's Suffrage the day before, M.
Arles Dufour being uneasy because Mill did not in
his speech recognize what women owed to Saint-Simonism.</p>

<p><i>July 19.</i>&mdash;Writing an introduction to "Middlemarch."
I have just re-read the 15th Idyll of Theocritus,
and have written three more sonnets. My
head uneasy. We went in the afternoon to the old
water-colors, finding that the exhibition was to close
at the end of the week. Burne-Jones's Circe and St.
George affected me, by their colors, more than any of
the other pictures&mdash;they are poems. In the evening
read Nisard on Rabelais and Marot.</p>

<p><i>July 22.</i>&mdash;Read Reybaud's book on "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Réformateurs
Modernes</span>." In the afternoon Mrs. P. Taylor
came and saw Thornie, who has been more uneasy
this week, and unwilling to move or come out on the
lawn.</p>

<p><i>July 23.</i>&mdash;Read Theocritus, Id. 16. Meditated
characters for "Middlemarch." Mrs. F. Malleson
came.</p>

<p><i>July 24.</i>&mdash;Still not quite well and clear-headed, so
that little progress is made. I read aloud Fourier
and Owen, and thought of writing something about
Utopists.</p>

<p><i>July 25.</i>&mdash;Read Plato's "Republic" in various
parts. After lunch Miss Nannie Smith, Miss Blythe,
Mr. Burton, and Mr. Deutsch. In the evening I read
Nisard, and Littré on Comte.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 1.</i>&mdash;Since last Sunday I have had an uncomfortable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
week from mental and bodily disturbance.
I have finished eleven sonnets on "Brother and Sister,"
read Littré, Nisard, part of 22d Idyll of Theocritus,
Sainte-Beuve, aloud to G. two evenings. Monday
evening looked through Dickson's "Fallacies of
the Faculty." On Tuesday afternoon we went to the
British Museum to see a new bronze, and I was enchanted
with some fragments of glass in the Slade collection,
with dyes of sunset in them. Yesterday, sitting
in Thornie's room, I read through all Shakespeare's
"Sonnets." Poor Thornie has had a miserably
unsatisfactory week, making no progress. After lunch
came Miss N. Smith and Miss Blythe, Mr. Burton, Mr.
and Mrs. Burne-Jones, and Mr. Sanderson.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>My last words to you might appear to imply something
laughably opposed to my real meaning. "Think
of me only as an example" meant&mdash;an example to be
avoided. It was an allusion in my mind to the servant-girl
who, being arrested for theft, said to her fellow-servant,
"Take example by me, Sally." With the
usual caprice of language, we say. "Make an example
of her," in that sense of holding up for a warning,
which the poor girl and I intended.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Journal,

<p><i>Aug. 2.</i>&mdash;Began "Middlemarch" (the Vincy and
Featherstone parts).</p>

<p><i>Aug. 5.</i>&mdash;Thornie during the last two or three days
gives much more hopeful signs: has been much more
lively, with more regular appetite and quieter nights.
This morning I finished the first chapter of "Middlemarch."
I am reading Renouard's "History of Medicine."</p>

<p><i>Aug. 31.</i>&mdash;We went to Weybridge, walked on St.
George's Hill, and lunched with Mrs. Cross and her
family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>This visit to Weybridge is a very memorable one
to me, because there my own first intimacy with
George Eliot began, and the bonds with my family
were knitted very much closer. Mr. and Mrs. Bullock
were staying with us; and my sister, who had
some gift for music, had set one or two of the
songs from the "Spanish Gypsy." She sang one
of them&mdash;"On through the woods, the pillared
pines"&mdash;and it affected George Eliot deeply. She
moved quickly to the piano, and kissed Mrs. Bullock
very warmly, in her tears. Mr. and Mrs. Lewes
were in deep trouble owing to the illness of Thornton
Lewes; we were also in much anxiety as to the
approaching confinement of my sister with her first
child; and I was on the eve of departure for America.
Sympathetic feelings were strong enough to
overleap the barrier (often hard to pass) which separates
acquaintanceship from friendship. A day
did the work of years. Our visitors had come to
the house as acquaintances, they left it as lifelong
friends. And the sequel of that day greatly intensified
the intimacy. For within a month my
sister had died in childbirth, and her death called
forth one of the most beautiful of George Eliot's
letters. A month later Thornton Lewes
died.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sept. 1.</i>&mdash;I meditated characters and conditions for
"Middlemarch," which stands still in the beginning of
chapter iii.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 2.</i>&mdash;We spent the morning in Hatfield Park,
arriving at home again at half-past three.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 10.</i>&mdash;I have achieved little during the last
week, except reading on medical subjects&mdash;Encyclopædia
about the "Medical Colleges," "Cullen's Life,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Russell's "Heroes of Medicine," etc. I have also
read Aristophanes' "Ecclesiazus&oelig;," and "Macbeth."</p>

<p><i>Sept. 11.</i>&mdash;I do not feel very confident that I can
make anything satisfactory of "Middlemarch." I
have need to remember that other things which have
been accomplished by me were begun under the same
cloud. G. has been reading "Romola" again, and expresses
profound admiration. This is encouraging.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 15.</i>&mdash;George and I went to Sevenoaks for a
couple of nights, and had some delicious walks.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 21.</i>&mdash;Finished studying again Bekker's "Charikles."
I am reading Mandeville's Travels. As to
my work, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">im Stiche gerathen</i>. Mrs. Congreve and
Miss Bury came; and I asked Mrs. Congreve to get
me some information about provincial hospitals, which
is necessary to my imagining the conditions of my hero.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>As to the Byron subject, nothing can outweigh to
my mind the heavy social injury of familiarizing young
minds with the desecration of family ties. The discussion
of the subject in newspapers, periodicals, and
pamphlets is simply odious to me, and I think it a
pestilence likely to leave very ugly marks. One trembles
to think how easily that moral wealth may be lost
which it has been the work of ages to produce in the
refinement and differencing of the affectionate relations.
As to the high-flown stuff which is being reproduced
about Byron and his poetry, I am utterly
out of sympathy with it. He seems to me the most
<em>vulgar-minded</em> genius that ever produced a great effect
in literature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Journal,

<p><i>Sept. 22.</i>&mdash;We went down to Watford for a change.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 24.</i>&mdash;Returned home this morning because of
the unpromising weather. It is worth while to record
my great depression of spirits, that I may remember
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
one more resurrection from the pit of melancholy.
And yet what love is given to me! What abundance
of good I possess! All my circumstances are blessed;
and the defect is only in my own organism. Courage
and effort!</p>

<p><i>Oct. 5.</i>&mdash;Ever since the 28th I have been good for
little, ailing in body and disabled in mind. On Sunday
an interesting Russian pair came to see us&mdash;M.
and Mme. Kovilevsky: she, a pretty creature, with
charming modest voice and speech, who is studying
mathematics (by allowance, through the aid of Kirchhoff)
at Heidelberg; he, amiable and intelligent,
studying the concrete sciences apparently&mdash;especially
geology; and about to go to Vienna for six months
for this purpose, leaving his wife at Heidelberg!</p>

<p>I have begun a long-meditated poem, "The Legend
of Jubal," but have not written more than twenty or
thirty verses.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 13.</i>&mdash;Yesterday Mr. W. G. Clark of Cambridge
came to see us, and told of his intention to give up
his oratorship and renounce his connection with the
Church.</p>

<p>I have read rapidly through Max Müller's "History
of Sanskrit Literature," and am now reading Lecky's
"History of Morals." I have also finished Herbert
Spencer's last number of his "Psychology." My head
has been sadly feeble, and my whole body ailing of
late. I have written about one hundred verses of my
poem. Poor Thornie seems to us in a state of growing
weakness.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 19.</i>&mdash;This evening at half-past six our dear
Thornie died. He went quite peacefully. For three
days he was not more than fitfully and imperfectly
conscious of the things around him. He went to Natal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
on the 17th October, 1863, and came back to us ill on
the 8th May, 1869. Through the six months of his illness
his frank, impulsive mind disclosed no trace of
evil feeling. He was a sweet-natured boy&mdash;still a boy,
though he had lived for twenty-five years and a half.
On the 9th of August he had an attack of paraplegia,
and although he partially recovered from it, it made a
marked change in him. After that he lost a great
deal of his vivacity, but he suffered less pain. This
death seems to me the beginning of our own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>The day after our dear boy's funeral we went into
the quietest and most beautiful part of Surrey, four
miles and a half from any railway station. I was very
much shaken in mind and body, and nothing but the
deep calm of fields and woods would have had a beneficent
effect on me. We both of us felt, more than
ever before, the blessedness of being in the country,
and we are come back much restored. It will interest
you, I think, to know that a friend of ours, Mr.
W. G. Clark, the public orator at Cambridge, laid down
his oratorship as a preparatory step to writing a letter
to his bishop renouncing, or, rather, claiming to be free
from, his clerical status, because he no longer believes
what it presupposes him to believe. Two other men
whom we know are about to renounce Cambridge fellowships
on the same ground.</p>

<p>I am moved to write to you rather by the inclination
to remind you of me than by the sense of having anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
to say. On reading "The Positivist
Problem"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
a second time, I gained a stronger impression of its
general value, and I also felt less jarred by the more
personal part at the close. Mr. Lewes would tell you
that I have an unreasonable aversion to personal statements,
and when I come to like them it is usually by
a hard process of <em>con</em>-version. But my second reading
gave me a new and very strong sense that the last two
or three pages have the air of an appendix, added at
some distance of time from the original writing of the
article. Some more thoroughly explanatory account
of your non-adhesion seems requisite as a nexus&mdash;since
the statement of your non-adhesion had to be mentioned
after an argument for the system against the
outer Gentile world. However, it is more important
for me to say that I felt the thorough justice of your
words, when, in conversation with me, you said, "I
don't see why there should be any mystification; having
come to a resolution after much inward debate, it
is better to state the resolution." Something like that
you said, and I give a hearty "Amen," praying that I
may not be too apt myself to prefer the haze to the
clearness. But the fact is, I shrink from decided "deliverances"
on momentous subjects from the dread of
coming to swear by my own "deliverances," and sinking
into an insistent echo of myself. That is a horrible
destiny&mdash;and one cannot help seeing that many of
the most powerful men fall into it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>Cara has told me about your republication of the
"Inquiry," and I have a longing to write&mdash;not intrusively,
I hope&mdash;just to say "thank you" for the good
it does me to know of your being engaged in that act
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of piety to your brother's memory. I delight in the
act itself, and in the satisfaction which I know you
have in performing it. When I remember my own obligation
to the book, I must believe that among the many
new readers a cheap edition will reach there must be
minds to whom it will bring welcome light in studying
the New Testament&mdash;sober, serious help towards a
conception of the past, instead of stage-lights and
make-ups. And this value is, I think, independent of
the opinions that might be held as to the different degrees
of success in the construction of probabilities or
in particular interpretations. Throughout there is the
presence of grave sincerity. I would gladly have a
word or two directly from yourself when you can scribble
a note without feeling me a bore for wanting it.
People who write many letters without being forced to
do so are fathomless wonders to me, but you have a
special faculty for writing such letters as one cares to
read, so it is a pity that the accomplishment should lie
quite unused. I wonder if you have read Emerson's
new essays. I like them very much.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>We shall leave Berlin on Tuesday, so that I must
ask you to send me the much-desired news of you to
Vienna, addressed to the Hon. Robert Lytton, British
Embassy. We do not yet know the name of the hotel
where rooms have been taken for us. Our journey
has not been unfortunate hitherto. The weather has
been cold and cheerless, but we expected this, and on
the 1st of April the sun began to shine. As for my
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wenigkeit</i>, it has never known a day of real bodily
comfort since we got to Berlin: headache, sore throat,
and <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schnupfen</i> have been alternately my companions,
and have made my enjoyment very languid. But think
of this as all past when you get my letter; for this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
morning I have a clearer head, the sun is shining, and
the better time seems to be come for me. Mr. Lewes
has had a good deal of satisfaction in his visits to laboratories
and to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charité</i>, where he is just now gone
for the third time to see more varieties of mad people,
and hear more about Psychiatrie from Dr. Westphal, a
quiet, unpretending little man, who seems to have been
delighted with George's sympathetic interest in this
(to me) hideous branch of practice. I speak with all
reverence: the world can't do without hideous studies.</p>

<p>People have been very kind to us, and have overwhelmed
us with attentions, but we have felt a little
weary in the midst of our gratitude, and since my cold
has become worse we have been obliged to cut off
further invitations.</p>

<p>We have seen many and various men and women,
but except Mommsen, Bunsen, and Du Bois Reymond,
hardly any whose names would be known to you. If
I had been in good health I should probably have continued
to be more amused than tired of sitting on a
sofa and having one person after another brought up
to bow to me, and pay me the same compliment. Even
as it was, I felt my heart go out to some good women
who seemed really to have an affectionate feeling towards
me for the sake of my books. But the sick animal
longs for quiet and darkness.</p>

<p>The other night, at Dr. Westphal's, I saw a young
English lady marvellously like Emily in face, figure,
and voice. I made advances to her on the strength
of that external resemblance, and found it carried out
in the quickness of her remarks. But new gentlemen
to be introduced soon divided us. Another elegant,
pretty woman there was old Boeckh's daughter. One
enters on all subjects by turns in these evening parties,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
which are something like reading the Conversations-Lexicon
in a nightmare. Among lighter entertainments
we have been four times to the opera, being
tempted at the very beginning of our stay by Gluck,
Mozart, and an opportunity of hearing Tannhäuser for
the second time. Also we have enjoyed some fine orchestral
concerts, which are to be had for sixpence!
Berlin has been growing very fast since our former
stay here, and luxury in all forms has increased so
much that one only here and there gets a glimpse of
the old-fashioned German housekeeping. But though
later hours are becoming fashionable, the members of
the Reichstag who have other business than politics
complain of having to begin their sitting at eleven, ending,
instead of beginning, at four, when the solid day is
almost gone. We went to the Reichstag one morning,
and were so fortunate as to hear Bismarck speak. But
the question was one of currency, and his speech was
merely a brief winding-up.</p>

<p>Now I shall think that I have earned a letter telling
me all about you. May there be nothing but good to
tell of! Pray give my best love to Emily, and my
earnest wishes to Dr. Congreve, that he may have satisfaction
in new work.</p>

<p>I gladly and gratefully keep the

For my
own part, I should have said, without hesitation, "Prefix
it to the 'Inquiry.'" One must not be unreasonable
about portraits. How can a thing which is always
the same be an adequate representation of a living being
who is always varying&mdash;especially of a living being
who is sensitive, bright, many-sided, as your brother
was? But I think the impression which this portrait
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
gives excites interest. I am often sorry for people
who lose half their possible good in the world by
being more alive to deficiencies than to positive
merits.</p>

<p>I like to know that you have felt in common with
me while you read "Jubal." Curiously enough, Mr.
Lewes, when I first read it to him, made just the remark
you make about the scene of Jubal coming with
the lyre. We laughed at Mr. Bray's sharp criticism.
Tell him it is not the fashion for authors ever to be in
the wrong. They have always justifying reasons. But
also it is the fashion for critics to know everything, so
that the authors don't think it needful to tell their reasons.</p>

<p><i>May 20.</i>&mdash;I am fond of my little old book in which
I have recorded so many changes, and shall take to
writing in it again. It will perhaps last me all through
the life that is left to me. Since I wrote in it last, the
day after Thornie's death, the chief epochs have been
our stay at Limpsfield, in Surrey, till near the beginning
of December; my writing of "Jubal," which I finished
on the 13th of January; the publication of the poem
in the May number of <cite>Macmillan's Magazine</cite>; and our
journey to Berlin and Vienna, from which we returned
on the 6th of this month, after an absence of eight
weeks. This is a fortnight ago, and little has been
done by me in the interim. My health is in an uncomfortable
state, and I seem to be all the weaker for
the continual depression produced by cold and sore
throat, which stretched itself all through our long
journey. These small bodily grievances make life less
desirable to me, though every one of my best blessings&mdash;my
one perfect love, and the sympathy shown towards
me for the sake of my works, and the personal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
regard of a few friends&mdash;have become much intensified
in these latter days. I am not hopeful about future
work. I am languid, and my novel languishes too.
But to-morrow may be better than to-day.</p>

<p><i>May 25.</i>&mdash;We started for Oxford, where we were to
stay with the Rector of Lincoln and his wife. After
luncheon G. and I walked alone through the town,
which, on this first view, was rather disappointing to
me. Presently we turned through Christ Church into
the meadows, and walked along by the river. This
was beautiful to my heart's content. The buttercups
and hawthorns were in their glory, the chestnuts still
in sufficiently untarnished bloom, and the grand elms
made a border towards the town. After tea we went
with Mrs. Pattison and the rector to the croquet-ground
near the Museum. On our way we saw Sir Benjamin
Brodie, and on the ground Professor Rawlinson, the
"narrow-headed man;" Mrs. Thursfield and her son,
who is a Fellow (I think, of Corpus); Miss Arnold,
daughter of Mr. Thomas Arnold, and Professor Phillips,
the geologist. At supper we had Mr. Bywater
and Miss Arnold, and in chat with them the evening
was passed.</p>

<p><i>May 26.</i>&mdash;G. and I went to the Museum, and had
an interesting morning with Dr. Rolleston, who dissected
a brain for me. After lunch we went again to
the Museum, and spent the afternoon with Sir Benjamin
Brodie, seeing various objects in his laboratories;
among others, the method by which weighing has been
superseded in delicate matters by <em>measuring</em> in a graduated
glass tube. Afterwards Mrs. Pattison took me
a drive in her little pony carriage round by their country
refuge, the Firs, Haddington, and by Littlemore,
where I saw J. H. Newman's little conventual dwelling.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Returning, we had a fine view of the Oxford towers.
To supper came Sir Benjamin and Lady Brodie.</p>

<p><i>May 27.</i>&mdash;In the morning we walked to see the two
Martyrs' Memorial, and then to Sir Benjamin Brodie's
pretty place near the river and bridge. Close by their
grounds is the original ford whence the place took its
name. The Miss Gaskells were staying with them,
and, after chatting some time, we two walked with Sir
Benjamin to New College, where we saw the gardens
surrounded by the old city wall; the chapel where
William of Wykeham's crosier is kept; and the cloisters,
which are fine, but gloomy, and less beautiful
than those of Magdalen, which we saw in our walk on
Thursday before going to the Museum. After lunch
we went to the Bodleian, and then to the Sheldonian
Theatre, where there was a meeting <i>à propos</i> of Palestine
Exploration. Captain Warren, conductor of the
Exploration at Jerusalem, read a paper, and then Mr.
Deutsch gave an account of the interpretation, as hitherto
arrived at, of the Moabite Stone. I saw squeezes
of this stone for the first time, with photographs taken
from the squeezes. After tea Mrs. Thursfield kindly
took us to see a boat-race. We saw it from the Oriel
barge, under the escort of Mr. Crichton, Fellow of
Merton, who, on our return, took us through the lovely
gardens of his college. At supper were Mr. Jowett,
Professor Henry Smith, and Miss Smith, his sister,
Mr. Fowler, author of "Deductive Logic," etc.</p>

<p><i>May 28.</i>&mdash;After a walk to St. John's College we
started by the train for London, and arrived at home
about two o'clock.</p>

<p><i>May 29.</i>&mdash;Mr. Spencer, Mrs. Burne-Jones, and Mr.
Crompton came. I read aloud No. 3 of "Edwin
Drood."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p><i>May 30.</i>&mdash;We went to see the autotypes of Michael
Angelo's frescoes, at 36 Rathbone Place. I began
Grove on the "Correlation of the Physical Forces"&mdash;needing
to read it again&mdash;with new interest, after the
lapse of years.</p>

<p>Dr. Reynolds advises Mr. Lewes to leave London
again, and go to the bracing air of the Yorkshire coast.
I said that we should be here till the beginning of August,
but the internal order proposes and the external
order disposes&mdash;if we are to be so priggish as to alter
all our old proverbs into agreement with new formulas!
Dickens's death came as a great shock to us.
He lunched with us just before we went abroad, and
was telling us a story of President Lincoln having told
the Council, on the day he was shot, that something
remarkable would happen, because he had just dreamt,
for the third time, a dream which twice before had preceded
events momentous to the nation. The dream
was, that he was in a boat on a great river, all alone, and
he ended with the words, "I drift&mdash;I drift&mdash;I drift."
Dickens told this very finely. I thought him looking
dreadfully shattered then. It is probable that he never
recovered from the effect of the terrible railway accident.</p>

<p>We have been driven away from home again by the
state of Mr. Lewes's health. Dr. Reynolds recommended
the Yorkshire coast; but we wanted to know
Cromer, and so we came here first, for the sake of variety.
To me the most desirable thing just now seems
to be to have one home, and stay there till death comes
to take me away. I get more and more disinclined to
the perpetual makeshifts of a migratory life, and care
more and more for the order and habitual objects of
home. However, there are many in the world whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
whole existence is a makeshift, and perhaps the formula
which would fit the largest number of lives is "a
doing without, more or less patiently." The air just
now is not very invigorating anywhere, I imagine, and
one begins to be very anxious about the nation generally,
on account of the threatening drought.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
the Hon.
Mrs. Robert
Lytton
(now Lady
Lytton),
8th July,
1870, from
Harrogate.</div>

<p>I did not like to write to
you<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
until Mr. Lytton sent
word that I might do so, because I had not the intimate
knowledge that would have enabled me to measure
your trouble; and one dreads, of all things, to
speak or write a wrong or unseasonable word when
words are the only signs of interest and sympathy that
one has to give. I know now, from what your dear
husband has told us, that your loss is very keenly felt
by you, that it has first made you acquainted with acute
grief, and this makes me think of you very much. For
learning to love any one is like an increase of property&mdash;it
increases care, and brings many new fears lest precious
things should come to harm. I find myself often
thinking of you with that sort of proprietor's anxiety,
wanting you to have gentle weather all through your
life, so that your face may never look worn and storm-beaten,
and wanting your husband to be and do the
very best, lest anything short of that should be disappointment
to you. At present the thought of you is
all the more with me because your trouble has been
brought by death; and for nearly a year death seems
to me my most intimate daily companion. I mingle
the thought of it with every other, not sadly, but as
one mingles the thought of some one who is nearest
in love and duty with all one's motives. I try to delight
in the sunshine that will be when I shall never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
see it any more. And I think it is possible for this
sort of impersonal life to attain great intensity&mdash;possible
for us to gain much more independence than is
usually believed of the small bundle of facts that make
our own personality. I don't know why I should say
this to you, except that my pen is chatting as my tongue
would if you were here. We women are always in
danger of living too exclusively in the affections, and
though our affections are, perhaps, the best gifts we
have, we ought also to have our share of the more independent
life&mdash;some joy in things for their own sake.
It is piteous to see the helplessness of some sweet
women when their affections are disappointed; because
all their teaching has been that they can only delight
in study of any kind for the sake of a personal love.
They have never contemplated an independent delight
in ideas as an experience which they could confess
without being laughed at. Yet surely women need
this sort of defence against passionate affliction even
more than men. Just under the pressure of grief, I
do not believe there is any consolation. The word
seems to me to be drapery for falsities. Sorrow must
be sorrow, ill must be ill, till duty and love towards all
who remain recover their rightful predominance. Your
life is so full of those claims that you will not have time
for brooding over the unchangeable. Do not spend
any of your valuable time now in writing to me, but be
satisfied with sending me news of you through Mr.
Lytton when he has occasion to write to Mr. Lewes.</p>

<p>I have lately finished reading aloud Mendelssohn's
"Letters," which we had often resolved and failed to
read before. They have been quite cheering to us
from the sense they give of communion with an eminently
pure, refined nature, with the most rigorous conscience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
in art. In the evening we have always a concert
to listen to&mdash;a concert of modest pretensions, but
well conducted enough to be agreeable.</p>

<p>I hope this letter of chit-chat will not reach you at a
wrong moment. In any case, forgive all mistakes on
the part of one who is always yours sincerely and affectionately.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 4.</i>&mdash;Two months have been spent since the last
record! Their result is not rich, for we have been
sent wandering again by G.'s want of health. On the
15th June we went to Cromer, on the 30th to Harrogate,
and on the 18th July to Whitby, where Mrs. Burne-Jones
also arrived on the same day. On Monday,
August 1, we came home again for a week only, having
arranged to go to Limpsfield next Monday. To-day,
under much depression, I begin a little dramatic
poem,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
the subject of which engaged my interest at

<p>We, too, you see, have come back to a well-tried
refuge&mdash;the same place that soothed us in our troubles
last October&mdash;and we especially delight in this deep
country after the fuss which belongs even to quiet watering-places,
such as Cromer, Harrogate, and Whitby,
which are, after all, "alleys where the gentle folks
live." We are excited, even among the still woods
and fields, by the vicissitudes of the war, and chiefly
concerned because we cannot succeed in getting the
day's <cite>Times</cite>. We have entered into the period which
will be marked in future historical charts as "The period
of German ascendency." But how saddening to
think of the iniquities that the great harvest-moon is
looking down on! I am less grieved for the bloodshed
than for the hateful trust in lies which is continually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
disclosed. Meanwhile Jowett's "Translation of
Plato" is being prepared for publication, and he has
kindly sent us the sheets of one volume. So I pass
from discussions of French lying and the Nemesis that
awaits it to discussions about rhetorical lying at Athens
in the fourth century before Christ. The translations
and introductions to the "Dialogues" seem to be
charmingly done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Madame
Bodichon,
25th Aug.
1870.</div>

<p>We shall return to town on Monday, various small
reasons concurring to make us resolve on quitting this
earthly paradise. I am very sorry for the sufferings
of the French nation; but I think these sufferings are
better for the moral welfare of the people than victory
would have been. The war has been drawn down on
them by an iniquitous government; but in a great proportion
of the French people there has been nourished
a wicked glorification of selfish pride, which, like
all other conceit, is a sort of stupidity, excluding any
true conception of what lies outside their own vain
wishes. The Germans, it seems, were expected to stand
like toy-soldiers for the French to knock them down.
It is quite true that the war is in some respects the
conflict of two differing forms of civilization. But
whatever charm we may see in the southern Latin
races, this ought not to blind us to the great contributions
which the German energies have made in all
sorts of ways to the common treasure of mankind.
And who that has any spirit of justice can help sympathizing
with them in their grand repulse of the French
project to invade and divide them? If I were a Frenchwoman,
much as I might wail over French sufferings,
I cannot help believing that I should detest the French
talk about the "Prussians." They wanted to throttle
the electric eel for their own purposes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>But I imagine that you and the doctor would not find
us in much disagreement with you in these matters.
One thing that is pleasant to think of is the effort made
everywhere to help the wounded.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 27.</i>&mdash;On Monday the 8th August we went to
our favorite Surrey retreat&mdash;Limpsfield&mdash;and enjoyed
three weeks there reading and walking together. The
weather was perfect, and the place seemed more lovely
to us than before. Aloud I read the concluding part
of Walter Scott's Life, which we had begun at Harrogate;
two volumes of Froude's "History of England,"
and Comte's "Correspondence with Valat." We returned
on Monday the 29th.</p>

<p>During our stay at Limpsfield I wrote the greater
part of "Armgart," and finished it at intervals during
September. Since then I have been continually suffering
from headache and depression, with almost total
despair of future work. I look into this little book
now to assure myself that this is not unprecedented.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara
Hennell,
18th Nov.
1870.</div>

<p>Yesterday, for the first time, we went to hear A. (a
popular preacher). I remembered what you had said
about his vulgar, false emphasis; but there remained
the fact of his celebrity. I was glad of the opportunity.
But my impressions fell below the lowest judgment I
ever heard passed upon him. He has the gift of a fine
voice, very flexible and various; he is admirably fluent
and clear in his language, and every now and then his
enunciation is effective. But I never heard any pulpit
reading and speaking which in its level tone was more
utterly common and empty of guiding intelligence or
emotion; it was as if the words had been learned by
heart and uttered without comprehension by a man
who had no instinct of rhythm or music in his soul.
And the doctrine! It was a libel on Calvinism that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
it should be presented in such a form. I never heard
any attempt to exhibit the soul's experience that was
more destitute of insight. The sermon was against
fear, in the elect Christian, as being a distrust of
God; but never once did he touch the true ground of
fear&mdash;the doubt whether the signs of God's choice are
present in the soul. We had plenty of anecdotes, but
they were all poor and pointless&mdash;Tract Society anecdotes
of the feeblest kind. It was the most superficial
grocer's-back-parlor view of Calvinistic Christianity;
and I was shocked to find how low the mental pitch
of our society must be, judged by the standard of this
man's celebrity.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes was struck with some of his tones as good
actor's tones, and was not so wroth as I was. But just
now, with all Europe stirred by events that make every
conscience tremble after some great principle as a consolation
and guide, it was too exasperating to sit and
listen to doctrine that seemed to look no further than
the retail Christian's tea and muffins. He said "Let
us approach the throne of God" very much as he might
have invited you to take a chair; and then followed
this fine touch&mdash;"We feel no love to God because he
hears the prayers of others; it is because he hears my
prayer that I love him."</p>

<p>You see I am relieving myself by pouring out my
disgust to you. Oh, how short life&mdash;how near death&mdash;seems
to me! But this is not an uncheerful thought.
The only great dread is the protraction of life into imbecility
or the visitation of lingering pain. That seems
to me the insurmountable calamity, though there is an
ignorant affectation in many people of underrating
what they call bodily suffering. I systematically abstain
from correspondence, yet the number of acquaintances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and consequent little appeals so constantly increases
that I often find myself inwardly rebelling
against the amount of note-writing that I cannot avoid.
Have the great events of these months interfered with
your freedom of spirit in writing? One has to dwell
continually on the permanent, growing influence of
ideas in spite of temporary reactions, however violent,
in order to get courage and perseverance for any work
which lies aloof from the immediate wants of society.
You remember Goethe's contempt for the Revolution
of '30 compared with the researches on the Vertebrate
Structure of the Skull? "My good friend, I was not
thinking of those people." But the changes we are
seeing cannot be doffed aside in that way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

Bodichon,
Nov. 1870.</div>

<p>Lying awake early in the morning, according to a
bad practice of mine, I was visited with much compunction
and self-disgust that I had ever said a word to you
about the faults of a friend whose good qualities are
made the more sacred by the endurance his lot has in
many ways demanded. I think you may fairly set
down a full half of any alleged grievances to my own
susceptibility, and other faults of mine which necessarily
call forth less agreeable manifestations from others
than as many virtues would do, if I had them. I trust
to your good sense to have judged well in spite of my
errors in the presentation of any matter. But I wish
to protest against myself, that I may, as much as possible,
cut off the temptation to what I should like
utterly to purify myself from for the few remaining
years of my life&mdash;the disposition to dwell for a moment
on the faults of a friend.</p>

<p>Tell the flower and fern giver, whoever it may be,
that some strength comes to me this morning from the
pretty proof of sympathy.

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

2d Dec. 1870.</div>

<p>I have it on my conscience that I may not have
given you a clear impression of my wishes about the
poor pensioner who was in question between us to-day,
so I write at once to secure us both against a possible
misunderstanding. I would rather not apply any more
money in that direction, because I know of other
channels<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
&mdash;especially a plan which is being energetically
carried out for helping a considerable group of
people without almsgiving, and solely by inducing them
to work&mdash;into which I shall be glad to pour a little
more aid. The repugnance to have relief from the
parish was a feeling which it was good to encourage
in the old days of contra-encouragement to sturdy
pauperism; but I question whether one ought now to indulge
it, and not rather point out the reasons why, in a
case of real helplessness, there is no indignity in receiving
from a public fund.</p>

<p>After you had left me, it rang in my ears that I had
spoken of my greater cheerfulness as due to a reduced
anxiety about myself and my doings, and had not
seemed to recognize that the deficit or evil in other
lives could be a cause of depression. I was not really
so ludicrously selfish while dressing myself up in the
costume of unselfishness. But my strong egoism has
caused me so much melancholy, which is traceable
simply to a fastidious yet hungry ambition, that I am
relieved by the comparative quietude of personal craving
which age is bringing. That is the utmost I have
to boast of, and, really, to be cheerful in these times
could only be a virtue in the sense in which it was felt
to be so by the old Romans when they thanked their
general for not despairing of the republic.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<p>I have been reading aloud to Mr. Lewes this evening
Mr. Harrison's article on "Bismarckism," which made
me cry&mdash;it is in some passages movingly eloquent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Journal,

<p><i>Dec. 2.</i>&mdash;I am experimenting in a story ("Miss
Brooke") which I began without any very serious intention
of carrying it out lengthily. It is a subject
which has been recorded among my possible themes
ever since I began to write fiction, but will probably
take new shapes in the development. I am to-day at
p. 44. I am reading Wolf's "Prolegomena to Homer."
In the evening, aloud, "Wilhelm Meister" again!</p>

<p><i>Dec. 12.</i>&mdash;George's mother died this morning quite
peacefully as she sat in her chair.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 17.</i>&mdash;Reading "Quintus Fixlein" aloud to G.
in the evening. Grote on Sicilian history.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 31.</i>&mdash;On Wednesday the 21st we went to Ryde
to see Madame Bodichon at Swanmore Parsonage, a
house which she had taken for two months. We had
a pleasant and healthy visit, walking much in the
frosty air. On Christmas Day I went with her to the
Ritualist Church which is attached to the parsonage,
and heard some excellent intoning by the delicate-faced,
tenor-voiced clergyman. On Wednesday last,
the 28th, Barbara came up to town with us. We found
the cold here more severe than at Ryde; and the papers
tell us of still harder weather about Paris, where
our fellow-men are suffering and inflicting horrors.</p>

<p>Here is the last day of 1870. I have written only
one hundred pages&mdash;good printed pages&mdash;of a story
which I began about the opening of November, and
at present mean to call "Miss Brooke." Poetry halts
just now.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara

<p>We spent our Christmas in the Isle of Wight, and
on Christmas Day I went to a Ritualist church and
heard some fine intoning of the service by a clear,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
strong, tenor voice, sweet singing from boys' throats,
and all sorts of Catholic ceremonial in a miniature way.</p>

<p>It is good to see what our neighbors are doing. To
live in seclusion with one's own thoughts is apt to give
one very false notions as to the possibilities of the
present time in the matter of conversion either to superstition
or anti-superstition.</p>

<p>In this cruel time, I no sooner hear of an affliction
than I see it multiplied in some one of the endless
forms of suffering created by this hellish war. In the
beginning I could feel entirely with the Germans, and
could say of that calamity called "victory," I am glad.
But now I can be glad of nothing. No people can carry
on a long, fierce war without being brutalized by it,
more or less, and it pains me that the educated voices
have not a higher moral tone about national and international
duties and prospects. But, like every one
else, I feel that the war is too much with me, and am
rather anxious to avoid unwise speech about it than to
utter what may seem to me to be wisdom. The pain
is that one can <em>do</em> so little.</p>

<p>I have not read "Sir Harry Hotspur," but as to
your general question, I reply that there certainly are
some women who love in that way, but "their sex as
well as I may chide them for it." Men are very fond
of glorifying that sort of dog-like attachment. It is
one thing to love because you falsely imagine goodness&mdash;that
belongs to the finest natures&mdash;and another to
go on loving when you have found out your mistake.
But married constancy is a different affair. I have
seen a grandly heroic woman who, out of her view as
to the responsibilities of the married relation, condoned
everything, took her drunken husband to her home
again, and at last nursed and watched him into penitence
and decency. But there may be two opinions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
even about this sort of endurance&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, about its ultimate
tendency, not about the beauty of nature which
prompts it. This is quite distinct from mere animal
constancy. It is duty and human pity.</p>

<p><i>March 19</i> (Sunday).&mdash;It is grievous to me how little,
from one cause or other, chiefly languor and occasionally
positive ailments, I manage to get done. I have
written about two hundred and thirty-six pages (print)
of my novel, which I want to get off my hands by next
November. My present fear is that I have too much
matter&mdash;too many <i>momenti</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I happened to-day to be talking to a very sweet-faced
woman (the sister of Dr. Bridges, whom I think
you know something of), and she mentioned, <i>à propos</i>
of educating children in the love of animals, that she
had felt the want of some good little book as a help in
this matter. I told her of yours, and when I said that
it was written by Mrs. Bray, the author of "Physiology
for Schools," she said, "Oh, I know that book well."
I have made her a present of my copy of "Duty to
Animals," feeling that this was a good quarter in which
to plant that offset. For she had been telling me of
her practical interest in the infant and other schools
in Suffolk, where she lives. We have had a great
pleasure to-day in learning that our friend Miss Bury
is engaged to be married to Mr. Geddes, a Scotch
gentleman. There is a streak of sadness for her family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
in the fact that she is to go to India with her husband
next November, but all else is bright in her prospect.
It is very sweet to see, and think of, the happiness
of the young. I am scribbling with an infirm head, at
the end of the day, just for the sake of letting you know
one proof, in addition doubtless to many others which
you have already had, that your pretty little book is
likely to supply a want.</p>

<p>We are very much obliged to you for your kind, methodical
thoughtfulness as to all which is necessary for
our accommodation at Brookbank, and also for your
hints about the points of beauty to be sought for
in our walks. That "sense of standing on a round
world," which you speak of, is precisely what I most
care for among out-of-door delights. The last time
I had it fully was at St. Märgen, near Freiburg, on
green hilltops, whence we could see the Rhine and
poor France.</p>

<p>The garden has been, and is being, attended to, and
I trust we shall not find the commissariat unendurable.</p>

<p>It seems like a resurrection of a buried-alive friendship
once more to have a letter from you. Welcome
back from your absorption in the Franchise! Somebody
else ought to have your share of work now, and
you ought to rest.</p>

<p>Ever since the 1st of May we have been living in
this queer cottage, which belongs to Mrs. Gilchrist,
wife of the Gilchrist who wrote the life of William
Blake the artist. We have a ravishing country round
us, and pure air and water; in short, all the conditions
of health, if the east wind were away. We have old
prints for our dumb companions&mdash;charming children
of Sir Joshua's, and large-hatted ladies of his and
Romney's. I read aloud&mdash;almost all the evening&mdash;books
of German science, and other gravities. So,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
you see, we are like two secluded owls, wise with unfashionable
wisdom, and knowing nothing of pictures
and French plays. I confess that I should have gone
often to see Got act if I had been in town, he is so
really great as an actor. And yet one is ashamed of
seeking amusement in connection with anything that
belongs to poor, unhappy France. I am saved from the
shame by being safely shut out from the amusement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Madame
Bodichon,
17th June,

<p>How about Madame Mohl and her husband? I
have been wondering through all the horrors whether
M. Mohl had returned to Paris, and whether their
house, containing, too probably, the results of much
studious work, lies buried among ruins. But I will
not further recall the sorrows in that direction.</p>

<p>I am glad to see the words "very satisfactory" in
connection with the visit to Hitchin and Cambridge.
Ely Cathedral I saw last year, but too cursorily. It
has more of the massive grandeur that one adores in
Le Mans and Chartres than most of our English cathedrals,
though I am ready to recall the comparison
as preposterous.</p>

<p>I don't know how long we shall stay here; perhaps,
more or less, till the end of August, for I have given
up the idea of going to the Scott Festival at Edinburgh,
to which I had accepted an invitation. The
fatigue of the long journey, with the crowd at the end,
would be too much for me.</p>

<p>Let us know beforehand when you are about coming.</p>

<p>George is gloriously well, and studying, writing,
walking, eating, and sleeping with equal vigor. He is
enjoying the life here immensely. Our country could
hardly be surpassed in its particular kind of beauty&mdash;perpetual
undulation of heath and copse, and clear
views of hurrying water, with here and there a grand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
pine wood, steep, wood-clothed promontories, and
gleaming pools.</p>

<p>If you want delightful reading get Lowell's "My
Study Windows," and read the essays called "My
Garden Acquaintances" and "Winter."</p>

<p>Get the volumes of a very cheap publication&mdash;the
"<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutscher Novellenschatz</span>." Some of the tales are
remarkably fine. I am reading aloud the last three
volumes, which are even better than the others. I
have just been so deeply interested in one of the stories&mdash;"<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Diethelm

to have the same pleasure who can read German.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>We are greatly obliged to you for the trouble you
have so sympathetically taken on our behalf, and we
shall prepare to quit our quiet shelter on Wednesday,
the 2d of August. During the first weeks of our stay
I did not imagine that I should ever be so fond of the
place as I am now. The departure of the bitter winds,
some improvement in my health, and the gradual revelation
of fresh and fresh beauties in the scenery, especially
under a hopeful sky such as we have sometimes
had&mdash;all these conditions have made me love our little
world here and wish not to quit it until we can settle
in our London home. I have the regret of thinking
that it was my original indifference about it (I hardly
ever like things until they are familiar) that hindered
us from securing the cottage until the end of September,
for the chance of coming to it again after a temporary
absence. But all regrets ought to be merged
in thankfulness for the agreeable weeks we have had,
and probably shall have till the end of July. And
among the virtues of Brookbank we shall always
reckon this, that our correspondence about it has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
with you rather than with any one else, so that, along
with the country, we have had a glimpse of your ready,

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Congreve,

July, 1871.</div>

<p>One word to you in response to Emily's note, which
comes to me this morning, and lets me know that by
this time she is probably in the last hour of her unmarried
life. My thoughts and love and tender anxiety
are with her and with all of you. When you receive
this she will, I suppose, be far away, and it is
of little consequence that I can make no new sign to
her of my joy in her joy.</p>

<p>For the next few weeks my anxiety will be concentrated
on you and yours at Yarmouth. Pray, when
your mind and body are sufficiently free from absorbing
occupation, remember my need of news about you,
and write to me. The other day I seemed to get a
glimpse of you through Mrs. Call, who told me that
you looked like a new creature&mdash;so much stronger
than you were wont; and she told me of Dr. Congreve's
address at the school, which raised my keenest
sympathy, and made me feel myself a very helpless friend.</p>

<p>Please give my love to the children, and tell Sophy
especially that I think her happy in this&mdash;that there
is a place made for all the effort of her young life to
fill it with something like the goodness and brightness
which she has known and has just now to part with.
I expect her to be your guardian angel, perhaps in a
new way&mdash;namely, in saving you from some fatigue
about details.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter

<p>I still feel that I owe you my thanks for your kind
letter, although Mr. Lewes undertook to deliver them
in the first instance. You certainly made a seat at the
Commemoration Table<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
look more tempting to me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
than it had done before; but I think that prudence
advises me to abstain from the fatigue and excitement
of a long railway journey, with a great gathering at the
end of it. If there is a chance that "Middlemarch"
will be good for anything, I don't want to break down
and die without finishing it. And whatever "the tow
on my distaff" may be, my strength to unwind it has
not been abundant lately.</p>

<p><i>À propos</i> of bodily prosperity, I am sincerely rejoiced
to know, by your postscript this morning, that Mr.
Simpson is recovered. I hope he will not object to
my considering him a good friend of mine, though it
is so long since I saw him. The blank that is left
when thorough workers like him are disabled is felt
not only near at hand, but a great way off. I often
say&mdash;after the fashion of people who are getting older&mdash;that
the capacity for good work, of the kind that
goes on without trumpets, is diminishing in the world.</p>

<p>The continuous absence of sunshine is depressing in
every way, and makes one fear for the harvest, and so
grave a fear that one is ashamed of mentioning one's
private dreariness. You cannot play golf in the rain,
and I cannot feel hopeful without the sunlight; but I
dare say you work all the more, whereas when my spirits
flag my work flags too.</p>

<p>I should have liked to see Principal Tulloch again,
and to have made the acquaintance of Captain Lockhart,
whose writing is so jaunty and cheery, yet so
thoroughly refined in feeling. Perhaps I may still
have this pleasure in town, when he comes up at the
same time with you. Please give my kind regards
to Mr. William Blackwood.</p>

<p>I don't see how I can leave anything out, because I
hope there is nothing that will be seen to be irrelevant
to my design, which is to show the gradual action of
ordinary causes rather than exceptional, and to show
this in some directions which have not been from time
immemorial the beaten path&mdash;the Cremorne walks and
shows of fiction. But the best intentions are good for
nothing until execution has justified them. And you
know I am always compassed about with fears. I am
in danger in all my designs of parodying dear Goldsmith's
satire on Burke, and think of refining when
novel-readers only think of skipping.</p>

<p>We are obliged to turn out of this queer cottage

<p>This morning your husband's letter came to us, but
if I did not know that it would be nearly a week before
any words of mine could reach you, I should abstain
from writing just yet, feeling that in the first days
of sorrowing it is better to keep silence. For a long
while after a great bereavement our only companionship
is with the lost one. Yet I hope it will not be
without good to you to have signs of love from your
friends, and to be reminded that you have a home in
their affections, which is made larger for you by your
trouble. For weeks my thought has been continually
going out to you, and the absence of news has made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
me so fearful that I have mourned beforehand. I
have been feeling that probably you were undergoing
the bitterest grief you had ever known. But under
the heart-stroke, is there anything better than to
grieve? Strength will come back for the duty and the
fellowship which gradually bring new contentments,
but at first there is no joy to be desired that would displace
sorrow.</p>

<p>What is better than to love and live with the loved?
But that must sometimes bring us to live with the
dead; and this too turns at last into a very tranquil
and sweet tie, safe from change and injury.</p>

<p>You see, I make myself a warrant out of my regard
for you, to write as if we had long been near each other.
And I cannot help wishing that we were physically
nearer&mdash;that you were not on the other side of Europe.
We shall trust in Mr. Lytton's kindness to let us hear
of you by and by. But you must never write except
to satisfy your own longing. May all true help surround
you, dear Mrs. Lytton, and whenever you can
think of me, believe in me as yours with sincere affection.</p>

to me that you had doubts about giving your name.
My faith is, that signature is right in the absence of
weighty special reasons against it.</p>

<p>We think of you all very often, and feel ourselves
much the richer for having a whole dear family to

that you are kept in London&mdash;by Parliamentary business,

<p>There is sunshine over our fields now, but the thermometer
is only 64° in the house, and in the warmest
part of the day I, having a talent for being cold, sit
shivering, sometimes even with a warm-water bottle at
my feet. I wonder if you went to the French plays
to see the supreme Got? That is a refined pleasure
which I enjoyed so much in Paris a few years
ago that I was sorry to be out of reach of it this
spring.</p>

<p>Thanks for your little picture of things. Eminently
acceptable in place of vague conjectures. I am a bitter
enemy to make-believe about the human lot, but I
think there is a true alleviation of distress in thinking
of the intense enjoyment which accompanies a spontaneous,
confident, intellectual activity. This may not
be a counterpoise to the existing evils, but it is at least
a share of mortal good, and good of an exquisite
kind.</p>

again, we expect to stay there from the first of September,
without projects of travel for many, many
months.</p>

<p>We enjoy our roomy house and pretty lawn greatly.
Imagine me seated near a window, opening under a
veranda, with flower-beds and lawn and pretty hills
in sight, my feet on a warm-water bottle, and my writing
on my knees. In that attitude my mornings are
passed. We dine at two; and at four, when the tea
comes in, I begin to read aloud. About six or half-past
we walk on to the commons and see the great
sky over our head. At eight we are usually in the
house again, and fill our evening with physics, chemistry,
or other wisdom if our heads are at par; if not,
we take to folly, in the shape of Alfred de Musset's
poems, or something akin to them.</p>

<p>Yesterday we returned from Weybridge, where, for
a few days, I have been petted by kind friends (delightful
Scotch people), and have had delicious drives
in the pure autumn air. That must be my farewell to
invalidism and holiday making. I am really better&mdash;not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
robust or fat, but perhaps as well as I am likely to
be till death mends me.</p>

<p>Your account of Mr.
Main<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
sets my mind at ease
about him; for in this case I would rather have your
judgment than any opportunity of forming my own.
The one thing that gave me confidence was his power
of putting his finger on the right passages, and giving
emphasis to the right idea (in relation to the author's
feeling and purpose). Apart from that, enthusiasm
would have been of little value.</p>

<p>One feels rather ashamed of authoresses this week
after the correspondence in the <cite>Times</cite>. One hardly
knows which letter is in the worst taste. However, if
we are to begin with marvelling at the little wisdom
with which the world is governed, we can hardly expect
that much wisdom will go to the making of
novels.</p>

<p>I should think it quite a compliment if the general
got through "Miss Brooke." Mr. Lewes amused himself
with the immeasurable contempt that Mr. Casaubon
would be the object of in the general's mind.</p>

<p>I hardly dare hope that the second part will take
quite so well as the first, the effects being more subtile
and dispersed; but Mr. Lewes seems to like the third
part better than anything that has gone before it. But
can anything be more uncertain than the reception of
a book by the public? I am glad to see that the
"Coming Race" has got into a fourth edition. Let
us hope that the Koom Posh may be at least mitigated
by the sale of a good book or two.</p>

<p>As for me, I get more and more unable to be anything

<p>If you have not yet fallen in with Dickens's "Life"
be on the lookout for it, because of the interest there
is in his boyish experience, and also in his rapid development
during his first travels in America. The
book is ill organized, and stuffed with criticism and
other matter which would be better in limbo; but the
information about the childhood, and the letters from
America, make it worth reading. We have just got a
photograph of Dickens, taken when he was writing, or
had just written, "David Copperfield"&mdash;satisfactory
refutation of that keepsakey, impossible face which
Maclise gave him, and which has been engraved for
the "Life" in all its odious beautification. This photograph
is the young Dickens, corresponding to the
older Dickens whom I knew&mdash;the same face, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>

<p>Your good wishes and pleasant bits of news made
the best part of my breakfast this morning. I am
glad to think that, in desiring happiness for you during
the new year, I am only desiring the continuance
of good which you already possess.</p>

<p>I suppose we two, also, are among the happiest of
mortals, yet we have had a rather doleful Christmas,
the one great lack, that of health, having made
itself particularly conspicuous in the surrounding fog.
Having no grandchildren to get up a Christmas-tree
for, we had nothing to divert our attention from our
headaches.</p>

<p>Mr. Main's book broke the clouds a little, and now
the heavens have altogether cleared, so that we are
hoping to come back from a visit of three days to
Weybridge with our strength renewed&mdash;if not like the
eagle's, at least like a convalescent tomtit's.</p>

<p>The "Sayings" are set off by delightful paper and
print, and a binding which opens with inviting ease.
I am really grateful to every one concerned in the volume,
and am anxious that it should not be in any way
a disappointment. The selections seem to me to be
made with an exquisite sensibility to the various lights
and shades of life; and all Mr. Main's letters show
the same quality. It is a great help to me to have
such an indication that there exist careful readers for
whom no subtilest intention is lost.

the deepest interest; indeed, with a quite exceptional
enjoyment of its direct, unexaggerated painting.</p>

<p>The prescription of two days' golfing per week will,
I hope, keep up your condition to the excellent pitch
at which it was on your return from Paris. Good
news usually acts as a tonic when one's case is not
too desperate; and I shall be glad if you and we can
get it in the form of more success for "Middlemarch."
Dickens's "Life," you see, finds a large public ready
to pay more. But the British mind has long entertained
the purchase of expensive biographies. The
proofs lately given that one's books don't necessarily
go out like lucifer matches, never to be taken up
again, make one content with moderate immediate
results, which perhaps are as much as can reasonably
be expected for any writing which does not address
itself either to fashions or corporate interests of an exclusive
kind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter

Blackwood,

<p>It is like your kindness to write me your encouraging
impressions on reading the third book. I suppose
it is my poor health that just now makes me think my
writing duller than usual. For certainly the reception
of the first book by my old readers is quite beyond my
most daring hopes. One of them, who is a great
champion of "Adam Bede" and "Romola," told Mr.
Lewes yesterday that he thought "Middlemarch" surpassed
them. All this is very wonderful to me. I
am thoroughly comforted as to the half of the work
which is already written; but there remains the terror
about the <em>un</em>written. Mr. Lewes is much satisfied
with the fourth book, which opens with the continuation
of the Featherstone drama.</p>

<p>We went yesterday to the Tichborne trial, which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
an experience of great interest to me. We had to
come away after the third hour of Coleridge's speaking;
but it was a great enjoyment to me to hear what
I did. Coleridge is a rare orator&mdash;not of the declamatory,
but of the argumentative order.</p>

<p>Thanks, not formal, but sincerely felt, for the photographs.
This likeness will always carry me back to
the first time I saw you, in our little Richmond lodging,
when I was thinking anxiously of "Adam Bede,"
as I now am of "Middlemarch."</p>

<p>I felt something like a shudder when Sir Henry
Maine asked me last Sunday whether this would not
be a very long book; saying, when I told him it
would be four good volumes, that that was what he
had calculated. However, it will not be longer than
Thackeray's books, if so long. And I don't see how
the sort of thing I want to do could have been done
briefly.</p>

<p>I have to be grateful for the gift of "Brougham's
Life," which will be a welcome addition to my means
of knowing the time "when his ugliness had not passed
its bloom."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>Your letter seems to pierce the rainy fog with a little
sunlight. Cold and clearness are the reverse of
what we are usually having here. Until the last few
days my chief consciousness has been that of struggling
against inward as well as outward fog; but I am
now better, and have only been dragged back into
headachiness by a little too much fatigue from visitors.
I give you this account as a preface to my renunciation
of a journey to Dover, which would be very delightful,
if I had not already lost too much time to be
warranted in taking a holiday.</p>

<p>Next Saturday we are going to have a party&mdash;six to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
dine, and a small rush of people after dinner, for the
sake of music. I think it is four years at least since
we undertook anything of that kind.</p>

<p>A great domestic event for us has been the arrival
of a new dog, who has all Ben's virtues, with more intelligence,
and a begging attitude of irresistible charm.
He is a dark-brown spaniel. You see what infantine
innocence we live in!</p>

<p>Glad you are reading my demigod Milton! We
also are rather old-fashioned in our light reading just
now; for I have rejected Heyse's German stories,
brand new, in favor of dear old Johnson's "Lives of
the Poets," which I read aloud in my old age with a
delicious revival of girlish impressions.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 29.</i>&mdash;It is now the last day but one of January.
I have finished the fourth part&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the second volume&mdash;of
"Middlemarch." The first part, published
on December 1, has been excellently well received;
and the second part will be published the day after
to-morrow. About Christmas a volume of extracts
from my works was published, under the title, "Wise,
Witty, and Tender Sayings, in Prose and Verse." It
was proposed and executed by Alexander Main, a
young man of thirty, who began a correspondence with
me by asking me how to pronounce Romola, in the
summer, when we were at Shottermill. Blackwood
proposed that we should share the profits, but we refused.</p>

<p>I do lead rather a crawling life under these rainy
fogs and low behavior of the barometer. But I am a
little better, on the whole, though just now overdone
with the fatigue of company. We have been to hear
Coleridge addressing the jury on the Tichborne trial&mdash;a
very interesting occasion to me. He is a marvellous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
speaker among Englishmen; has an exquisitely
melodious voice, perfect gesture, and a power of keeping
the thread of his syntax to the end of his sentence,
which makes him delightful to follow. We are going
some other day, if possible, to hear a cross-examination
of Ballantyne's. The digest of the evidence which
Coleridge gives is one of the best illustrations of the
value or valuelessness of testimony that could be given.
I wonder if the world, which retails Guppy anecdotes,
will be anything the wiser for it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter

<p>To hear of a friend's illness after he has got well
through it is the least painful way of learning the bad
news. I hope that your attack has been a payment
of insurance.</p>

<p>You probably know what it grieved us deeply to
learn the other day&mdash;that our excellent friend Mr.
William Smith is dangerously ill. They have been
so entirely happy and wrapped up in each other that
we cannot bear to think of Mrs. Smith's grief.</p>

<p>Thanks for the list of sales since February 12th.
Things are encouraging, and the voices that reach us
are enthusiastic. But you can understand how people's
interest in the book heightens my anxiety that
the remainder should be up to the mark. It has
caused me some uneasiness that the third part is two
sheets less than the first. But Mr. Lewes insisted
that the death of old Featherstone was the right point
to pause at; and he cites your approbation of the part
as a proof that effectiveness is secured in spite of diminished
quantity. Still it irks me to ask 5<i>s.</i> for a
smaller amount than that already given at the same
price. Perhaps I must regard the value as made up
solely by effectiveness, and certainly the book will be
long enough.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>I am still below par in strength, and am too much
beset with visitors and kind attentions. I long for the
quiet spaces of time and the absence of social solicitations
that one enjoys in the country, out of everybody's
reach.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear of the pleasure "Middlemarch"
gives in your household: that makes quite a little preliminary
public for me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I can understand very easily that the two last years
have been full for you of other and more imperative
work than the writing of letters not absolutely demanded
either by charity or business. The proof that
you still think of me affectionately is very welcome
now it is come, and all the more cheering because it
enables me to think of you as enjoying your retreat in
your orange orchard&mdash;your western Sorrento&mdash;the beloved
Rabbi still beside you. I am sure it must be a
great blessing to you to bathe in that quietude&mdash;as it
always is to us when we go out of reach of London influences,
and have the large space of country days to
study, walk, and talk in. Last year we spent our summer
months in Surrey, and did not leave England.
Unhappily, the country was not so favorable to my
bodily health as to my spiritual, and on our return to
town I had an illness which was the climax of the
summer's <i>malaise</i>. That illness robbed me of two
months, and I have never quite recovered a condition
in which the strict duties of the day are not felt as a
weight. But just now we are having some clear spring
days, and I am in hope of prospering better, the
sunshine being to me the greatest visible good of
life&mdash;what I call the wealth of life, after love and
trust.</p>

<p>When I am more at liberty I will certainly read
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Mr. Owen's books, if he is good enough to send them
to me. I desire on all subjects to keep an open mind,
but hitherto the various phenomena reported or attested
in connection with ideas of spirit-intercourse,
"psychion," and so on, have come before me here in
the painful form of the lowest <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">charlatanerie</i>. Take
Mr. H. as an example of what I mean. I could not
choose to enter a room where he held a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">séance</i>. He
is an object of moral disgust to me; and nothing of
late reported by Mr. Crookes, Lord Lindsay, and the
rest carries conviction to my mind that Mr. H. is not
simply an impostor, whose professedly abnormal manifestations
have varied their fashion in order to create
a new market, just as if they were <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">papier mâché</i> wares
or pomades for the idle rich. But apart from personal
contact with people who get money by public exhibitions
as mediums, or with semi-idiots, such as those
who make a court for a Mrs. Guppy or other feminine
personage of that kind, I would not willingly place any
barriers between my mind and any possible channel
of truth affecting the human lot.</p>

<p>The spirit in which you have written in the paper
you kindly sent me is likely to teach others&mdash;to rouse
them, at least, to attention in a case where you have
been deeply impressed.</p>

<p>I write to you quite openly, dear friend, but very imperfectly,
for my letters are always written in shreds
of time.</p>

<p>Thanks for the budget of this morning. The sales,
we think, are very cheering, and we may well be content
if they continue in the same ratio. But the Greek
proverb about the beginning being the half of the
whole wants as much defining and excepting from as
most other proverbs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>I have just had sent me a copy of the magazine
<cite>Für die Literatur des Auslander</cite>, containing a review
of "Miss Brooke," which will be good for Asher's
edition, and is otherwise satisfactory as an intelligent
appreciation. It mentions at the end the appearance
of Mr. Main's book, "The Sayings." A Frenchman,
apparently accomplished, a M. Landolphe, who has
made some important translations, is going to translate
the whole of "Middlemarch;" and one of the
contributors to the <cite>Revue des Deux Mondes</cite> has written
for leave to extract Dorothea's history.</p>

<p>I fancy we have done a good turn to English authors
generally by setting off Asher's series, for we have
heard that Tauchnitz has raised his offers. There is
another way in which benefit might come that would
be still more desirable&mdash;namely, to make him more
careful in his selections of books for reprint. But I
fear that this effect is not so certain. You see Franz
Duncker, who publishes the German translation of
"Middlemarch," has also begun an English series.
This is really worth while, for the Germans are excellent
readers of our books. I was astonished to
find so many in Berlin who really knew one's books,
and did not merely pay compliments after the fashion
of the admirers who made Rousseau savage&mdash;running
after him to pay him visits, and not knowing a word
of his writing.</p>

<p>You and other good readers have spoiled me, and
made me rather shudder at being read only once; and
you may imagine how little satisfaction I get from
people who mean to please me by saying that they
shall wait till "Middlemarch" is finished, and then
sit up to read it "at one go-off."</p>

<p>We are looking for a country retreat not too far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
from town, so that we may run up easily. There is
nothing wanting to our happiness except that "Middlemarch"
should be well ended without growing
signs of its author's debility.</p>

<p>Brighton does not suit Mr. Lewes. But he was
near going there for a night a little while ago to see
our friends, Mr. and Mrs. William Smith. He (the
author of "Thorndale," etc.) is, I fear, wasting fatally
with organic disease, and we grieve much at the too-probably
near parting of a husband and wife who
have been among the perfectly happy couples of the
world. She is a charming woman, and I wish that
you may happen to know her.</p>

<p>Owing to my loss of two months in illness, and my
infirm health ever since, I have not yet finished the
writing of "Middlemarch." This payment of wintry
arrears makes one prefer the comforts of a London
home; but we are obliged to see more company than
my health is equal to, and for this reason I dare say
we shall soon migrate. To-day we have been to our
last morning concert&mdash;or Saturday Pop.&mdash;held on a
Friday because of the University boat-race to-morrow.
These concerts are an easy pleasure which we are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
sorry to part with. This is one of my bad weeks,
owing probably to the change in the weather, and I
am constantly struggling with hemicrania and <i>malaise</i>.
Even writing this scrap of a note is the feather too
much, and I must leave off. You have known too

<p><i>May 8.</i>&mdash;I have been reposing for more than a
week in the hope of getting stronger, my life having
been lately a swamp of illness, with only here and
there a bit of firm walking. In consequence of this
incessant interruption (almost every week having been
half nullified for me so far as my work has been concerned)
I have only finished the fifth book, and have
still three books to write&mdash;equal to a large volume
and a half.</p>

<p>The reception of the book hitherto has been quite
beyond what I could have believed beforehand, people
exalting it above everything else I have written.
Kohn is publishing an English edition in Germany;
Duncker is to publish a translation; and Harpers
pay me £1200 for reprinting it in America.</p>

the noises and small excitements that break up the
day and scatter one's nervous energy in London.</p>

<p>We have been in our hiding-place about twelve days
now, and I am enjoying it more and more&mdash;getting
more bodily ease and mental clearness than I have
had for the last six months. Our house is not in the
least beautiful, but it is well situated and comfortable,
perfectly still in the middle of a garden surrounded
by fields and meadows, and yet within reach of shops
and civilization.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>We managed to get to the Academy one day before
leaving town. I was delighted with Walker's picture&mdash;were
you?&mdash;and Mason's unfinished Reaper, and a
few, very few, others.</p>

<p>Also we went twice to the opera in order to save
ourselves from any yearnings after it when we should
have settled in the country.</p>

<p>We tell no one our address, and have our letters
sent on from the Priory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. H. B.

<p>We too are in a country refuge, you see, and this
bit of Surrey, as I dare say you know, is full of beauty
of the too garden-like sort for which you pity us.
How different from your lodge in the wilderness! I
have read your description three or four times&mdash;it
enchants me so thoroughly&mdash;and Mr. Lewes is just
as much enamoured of it. We shall never see it, I
imagine, except in the mirror of your loving words;
but thanks, many and warm, dear friend, for saying
that our presence would be welcome. I have always
had delight in descriptions of American forests since
the early days when I read "Atala," which I believe
that you would criticise as half unveracious. I dwelt
on the descriptions in "Dred" with much enjoyment.</p>

<p>Pray give my special thanks to the Professor for
his letter. His handwriting, which does really look
like Arabic&mdash;a very graceful character, surely&mdash;happens
to be remarkably legible to me, and I did not
hesitate over a single word. Some of the words, as
expressions of fellowship, were very precious to me,
and I hold it very good of him to write to me that
best sort of encouragement. I was much impressed
with the fact&mdash;which you had told me&mdash;that he was
the original of the "visionary boy" in "Old Town
Folk;" and it must be deeply interesting to talk with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
him on his experience. Perhaps I am inclined, under
the influence of the facts, physiological and psychological,
which have been gathered of late years, to
give larger place to the interpretation of vision-seeing
as <em>subjective</em> than the Professor would approve. It
seems difficult to limit&mdash;at least to limit with any precision&mdash;the
possibility of confounding sense by impressions,
derived from inward conditions, with those
which are directly dependent on external stimulus.
In fact, the division between within and without in
this sense seems to become every year a more subtle
and bewildering problem.</p>

<p><em>Your</em> experience with the <i>planchette</i> is amazing; but
that the words which you found it to have written
were dictated by the spirit of Charlotte Brontë is to
me (whether rightly or not) so enormously improbable,
that I could only accept it if every condition were laid
bare, and every other explanation demonstrated to be
impossible. If it were another spirit aping Charlotte
Brontë&mdash;if here and there at rare spots and among
people of a certain temperament, or even at many
spots and among people of all temperaments, tricksy
spirits are liable to rise as a sort of earth-bubbles and
set furniture in movement, and tell things which we
either know already or should be as well without
knowing&mdash;I must frankly confess that I have but a
feeble interest in these doings, feeling my life very
short for the supreme and awful revelations of a more
orderly and intelligible kind which I shall die with
an imperfect knowledge of. If there were miserable
spirits whom we could help, then I think we should
pause and have patience with their trivial-mindedness;
but otherwise I don't feel bound to study them more
than I am bound to study the special follies of a particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
phase of human society. Others who feel differently,
and are attracted towards this study, are
making an experiment for us as to whether anything
better than bewilderment can come of it. At present
it seems to me that to rest any fundamental part of
religion on such a basis is a melancholy misguidance
of men's minds from the true sources of high and pure
emotion.</p>

<p>I am comforted to think that you partly agree with
me there.</p>

<p>I have not time to write more than this very imperfect
fragmentary sketch of <em>only one</em> aspect which
the question of spirit-communications wears to me at
present&mdash;being always rather brain-weary after my
morning's work, and called for by my husband to
walk with him and read aloud to him. I spend nearly
three hours every day in this exercise of reading
aloud, which, happily, I can carry on without fatigue
of lungs. Yet it takes strength as well as time.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes is gone into town to-day, so I have an
additional hour at liberty, and have been glad to be
able to send you a letter which is not worth anything,
indeed, but which satisfies my need to thank you and
the Professor for your sweet friendliness&mdash;very sweet
to me, I assure you. Please accept my entire frankness
as a proof of that high value I set on you. And
do not call anything I may have written a prejudice&mdash;it
is simply a statement of how certain things appear
to my inward eyesight, which I am ready to have rectified
by more light.</p>

<p>About photographs&mdash;I have <em>no</em> photograph of myself,
having always avoided having one taken. That
makes me seem very selfish in being particularly glad
to get yours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Fields, with the beautiful face and charming
manners, sent me a letter a little while ago, inviting
us in the most tempting way to go to Boston. She
said that this pretty action was done at your prompting,
which is just like you as you have always shown
yourself to me.</p>

<p>Dear friend, how much you have lived through,
both in the flesh and in the spirit! My experience
has been narrow compared with yours. I assure you
I feel this, so do not misinterpret anything I say to
you as being written in a flippant or critical spirit.

accompany a letter and give it the right tone.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes had "a lovely time" from Saturday to
Monday at Weybridge. He was feeling languid, and
yet was tempted to sit at his desk. The little change
has been very serviceable, and he is now bright.</p>

<p>Our first book, read aloud by me after we came
down, was Wallace's "Eastern Archipelago," which,
I think, you had spoken well of to Mr. Lewes. It is
delightful. The biography of the infant ourang-outang
alone is worth getting the book for. We are now in
the middle of Tylor's "Primitive Culture," which is
worth studying, and useful for reference on special
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
points, if you happen to want knowledge about the
ideas of the savage tribes.</p>

<p>This morning came the joyful news that Gertrude
has a fine healthy baby&mdash;a daughter. We have just
been saying in our walk that by the end of this century
our one-day-old granddaughter will probably be
married and have children of her own, while we are
pretty sure to be at rest. This obvious kind of wisdom
does very well for discourse in the delicious sunshine,
as we wander over a hilly, half fern-clad, half
grassy wilderness called South Park, from which we
can overlook two fertile bosky valleys. We like this
bit of country better and better. As to health, I am
not quite so prosperous as I was at first, but to make
amends, Mr. Lewes is in a good average condition,
and only now and then has a morning in which he is
forced to wander about instead of going to his beloved
work. We have had much happiness here,
much sympathy in letters from far-off friends unknown
in the flesh, and peaceful enjoyment of our
occupations. But we have longed for more continuous
warmth and brightness, and to-day may perhaps
be the beginning of that one wanting condition.</p>

<p>The death of that honored, good creature, Mr. William
Smith, touched us particularly, because of the perfect
marriage-bond which had made the last eleven
years of his life unspeakably precious both to him
and his wife. Mr. Lewes offered to go to Brighton to
see him; but he was so reduced, so very feeble in
body, though he kept to the last much brightness of
mind, that Mrs. Smith feared for him the excitement
of seeing friends who came, specially, from a distance.

of Italian sunshine, as the small birds hopping after
the rain seem part of the moist happiness at home.</p>

<p>I shall send Part VII. in a few days. Since Mr.
Lewes tells me that the <cite>Spectator</cite> considers me the
most melancholy of authors, it will perhaps be a welcome
assurance to you that there is no unredeemed
tragedy in the solution of the story.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes examines the newspapers before I see
them, and cuts out any criticisms which refer to me,
so as to save me from these spiritual chills&mdash;though,
alas! he cannot save me from the physical chills
which retard my work more seriously. I had hoped
to have the manuscript well out of my hands before
we left this place at the end of the month, but the
return of my dyspeptic troubles makes me unable to
reckon on such a result.</p>

<p>It will be a good plan, I think, to quicken the publication
towards the end; but we feel convinced that
the slow plan of publication has been of immense advantage
to the book in deepening the impression it
produces. Still I shudder a little to think what a long
book it will be&mdash;not so long as "Vanity Fair" or
"Pendennis," however, according to my calculation.</p>

<p>How good the articles on French manners and domestic
life are in "Maga." The spirit in which they
are written is excellent.

<p>I am tired of behaving like an ungrateful wretch&mdash;making
no sign in answer to affectionate words which
have come to me with cheering effect. And I want
to tell you and Mr. Hall (alas! for the dear old
name<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
which had such cherished associations) that I long
too much to see you all at Six-Mile Bottom, to give
up utterly the prospect of that good. We imagine
that the place is near Ipswich, which is no more
than an hour and fifty minutes from London. If
so, the journey would be easily managed, and would
be worth taking for the sake of one whole day and
two half days with you&mdash;just as if you were the hour
nearer, at Weybridge&mdash;before we set our faces towards
Germany. I am not hopeless that we might do that
in the second week of September, if you are not quite
disgusted with the thought of me as a person who is
always claiming pity for small ailments, and also if
Mr. Hall can secure me against being shot from the
other side of the hedge by the Prince of
Wales,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
while
we are discussing plantations.</p>

<p>I dare not count much on fulfilling any project, my
life for the last year having been a sort of nightmare,
in which I have been scrambling on the slippery bank
of a pool, just keeping my head above water. But I
shall be the happier for having told you that I delight
in the double invitation for the sake of the love it assures
me of, and that I do want to see you all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<p>You are all gloriously well, I hope, and Alkie looking
more and more cherubic, and Emily and Florence
blooming. My best love to all. Particular regards
to J., and regrets that we were not on his route from
Brindisi. I read his paper on New York with much
interest and satisfaction.</p>

<p>You are often among my imaged companions both
in dreaming and waking hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Cross,
Oct. 1872,
from Homburg.</div>

<p>It was a delightful surprise to see your handwriting
when we went to inquire at the <i>Poste Restante</i>. We
had, on the whole, a fortunate journey, and are especially
grateful to Mr. Hall for suggesting the route
by Trèves, where we spent two nights and an exquisite
day. I was continually reminded of Rome when we
were wandering in the outskirts in search of the antiquities,
and the river banks are a loveliness into the
bargain which Rome has not. We had even an opportunity
of seeing some dissipation, for there happened
to be an excellent circus, where we spent our
evening. The pretty country through which we passed
had an additional interest for us about Libramont.</p>

<p>The air, the waters, the plantations here are all perfect&mdash;"only
man is vile." I am not fond of denouncing
my fellow-sinners, but gambling being a vice I
have no mind to, it stirs my disgust even more than
my pity. The sight of the dull faces bending round
the gaming-tables, the raking up of the money, and
the flinging of the coins towards the winners by the
hard-faced croupiers, the hateful, hideous women staring
at the board like stupid monomaniacs&mdash;all this
seems to me the most abject presentation of mortals
grasping after something called a good that can be
seen on the face of this little earth. Burglary is heroic
compared with it. I get some satisfaction in looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
on, from the sense that the thing is going to be put
down. Hell is the only right name for such places.</p>

<p>It was cruel to find the bitter cold just set in as we
arrived. For two days we were as cold as in clear
winter days at Berlin. There are no amusements for
the evening here, and the pleasure of listening to the
excellent band in the afternoons is diminished by the
chillness which makes one fear to sit down in the open
air. But we like being idle, and the days pass easily.</p>

<p>It is good to have in our memories the two happy
days at Six-Mile Bottom; and the love that surrounded
me and took care of me there is something very
precious to believe in among hard-faced strangers.
Much gratitude for the anticipated letter that will
come to tell us more news of you by-and-by.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
John
Blackwood,
4th
Oct. 1872.</div>

<p>At last I begin a letter which is intended not as a
payment but as an acknowledgment of debt. It will
have at least the recommendation of requiring no
answer. After some perfect autumnal days we are
languishing with headache from two days' damp and
mugginess, and feel it almost as much work as we are
equal to to endure our <i>malaise</i>. But on the whole we
are not sorry that we came to this place rather than
any other. On dry days the air is perfect, and the
waters are really an enticing drink. Then there is a
wood close by where we can wander in delicious privacy:
which is really better than the company here,
save and except a few friends whom we found at first,
and who have now moved off to Baden. The Kursaal
is to me a hell, not only for the gambling but for the
light and heat of the gas, and we have seen enough
of its monstrous hideousness. There is very little
dramatic <i>Stoff</i> to be picked up by watching or listening.
The saddest thing to be witnessed is the play
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of a young lady, who is only twenty-six years old, and
is completely in the grasp of this mean, money-making
demon. It made me cry to see her young, fresh face
among the hags and brutally stupid men around her.
Next year, when the gambling has vanished, the place
will be delightful; there is to be a subvention from
Government to keep up the beautiful grounds; and it
is likely that there will be increase enough in the number
of decent visitors to keep the town tolerably prosperous.
One attraction it has above other German
baths that I have seen is the abundance of pleasant
apartments to be had, where one can be as peaceful
as the human lot allows in a world of pianos.</p>

<p>Asher's cheap editions are visible everywhere by
the side of Tauchnitz, but the outside is not, I think,
quite equally recommendable and recommending.</p>

<p>We brought no books with us, but have furnished
our table with German books which we bought at
Frankfort, from learned writing about Menschlich
Sprache and Vernunft down to Kotzebue's comedies,
so that we have employment for the rainy hours when
once our heads are clear of aches. The certainty that
the weather is everywhere else bad will help our resolution
to stay here till the 12th at least. In the mean
time we hope to have the proof of the finale to "Middlemarch."</p>

<p>I am rejoiced to learn from Mr. William's letter
that Mr. Simpson has returned from his excursion in
good condition. That must be a comfort to you, both
for friendship and for work's sake.</p>

<p>We mean to return by Paris, and hope that the
weather will not drive us away from health and pleasure-seeking
until the end of the month. I fear, from
the accounts of your Scottish weather, that you will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
have enjoyed Strathtyrum less than usual, and will be
resigned to Edinburgh before your proper time. How
one talks about the weather! It is excusable here
where there is no grave occupation, and no amusement
for us, who don't gamble, except seeking health
in walks and water drinking.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Cross,
27th Oct.
1872, from
Boulogne.</div>

<p>I had meant to write to you again from Germany,
but I was hindered from doing so by the uncertainty
of our plans, which vacillated between further wanderings
in South Germany and the usual dreary railway
journeying by Strasburg to Paris. As it was, we left
Homburg on the 13th and had ten days of delicious
autumnal weather and quietude at Stuttgart and Carlsruhe&mdash;ten
days which made the heart of our enjoyment.
We still hesitated whether we should go to
Augsburg, and even Munich, making our way home
through Germany and Belgium, and turning our shoulders
on Paris. Our evil genius persuaded us to go to
Paris and to make the journey by night&mdash;whence came
headache and horrible disgust with the shops of the
Rue de la Paix and the Boulevard. After going to
Versailles in the rain, seeing the sad ruins of the
Hotel de Ville, missing the Theatre Français, and
getting "Patrie" in exchange, we rushed away to this
place, where we are trying to recover the sense of
benefit from our change, which forsook us on quitting
old Germany. We have an affinity for what the world
calls "dull places," and always prosper best in them.
We are sure to be at home next week, and I hope before
long to have some news of you there&mdash;some dear
faces coming to bring it. We shall linger here a few
days and take a favorable time for crossing, but our
patience will hardly last beyond Friday.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Wm.

Nov. 1872.</div>

<p>We returned yesterday evening from six weeks' absence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in Germany, and I found your dear, sad letter
among the many awaiting me. I prize very highly
the fact that you like to write to me and bear me in
your mind as one who has a certain fellowship in your
sorrow; and I do trust that this letter may reach you
in time to prevent you from thinking, even for a moment,
that I could be indifferent about responding to
any word you send me. I shall address it to the care
of Blackwood &amp; Sons, because I imagine you to be
by this time in Edinburgh with that delightful friend,
Mrs. Stirling, whom I had much kindness from many
years ago when I was on a visit to Mr. and Mrs.
George Combe. She took me to hear Dr. Guthrie
and Dr. Candlish, and through her I saw Craigcrook.
I like to think of those hours and her pleasant talk.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes, I am thankful to say, has been getting
more robust for the last two years, and is very bright
and active. I think there is hardly any one left to
whom he would so willingly have written or talked
about the subjects which are filling his mind as that
dear one who is gone from your side, but is perpetually
present in your consciousness. To-day I have
been reading the memorial article in <cite>Blackwood</cite>, and
have been hoping that there is nothing in it which
jars on your feeling. Everybody will think as I do&mdash;that
the bits from your pen are worth all the rest. I
have been especially moved, though, by the two stanzas
quoted at the end. Mr. Lewes judges that the writer
of the article did not personally know your husband,
and wishes that more special touches had been given.
I know, dear friend, that the sorrow is irremediable;
but the pain&mdash;the anguish&mdash;will become less sharp
and life will be less difficult. You will think of things
to do such as he would approve of your doing, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
every day will be sacred with his memory&mdash;nay, his
presence. There is no pretence or visionariness in
saying that he is still part of you. Mr. Lewes sends
his affectionate regards, which you will not reject.
We mention your name to each other with a certain
tenderness, as if your sorrow somehow belonged to
our love for each other. But I hardly dare to think
of what these words which I have written mean.
Sometimes in the midst of happiness I cry suddenly
at the thought that there must come a parting. Are
not you and I very near to one another? I mean in
feeling.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Peter
Taylor,
19th Nov.
1872.</div>

<p>I found a letter from dear Mrs. William Smith on
my return, and I have had another since in answer to
mine. It is inevitable that her sense of loss should
deepen for some time to come. I am hoping that by-and-by
active interests will arise to make her feel that
her life is useful.</p>

<p>The article in <cite>Blackwood</cite> was chiefly valuable for
the extracts it contained from Mrs. Smith's own memoir.
One felt that the writer of the article had not
known Mr. William Smith personally; but her sketches
did something to supply that defect. Mr. Lewes felt
a peculiar attachment to him. He had always been
thoroughly sympathetic, both morally and intellectually,
and it was a constant regret to us that he and
Mrs. Smith were so far away. There was no man
with whom Mr. Lewes would have found it so pleasant
to discuss questions of science and philosophy&mdash;his
culture was so rare and his disposition so free from
littleness: and his wife was worthy of him.</p>

<p>Gertrude's little Blanche is a charming young lady&mdash;fat,
cooing, and merry. It is a great comfort to
see her with this hope fulfilled&mdash;I mean to see Gertrude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
with her hope fulfilled, and not Blanche, as the
grammar seemed to imply. That small person's hopes
are at present easy of fulfilment.</p>

<p>We have made but one expedition since our return,
and that was to see the pictures at Bethnal Green&mdash;altogether
a cheering and delightful sight. Of course
you saw them long ago. The Troyon is my favorite.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara
Hennell,
19th Nov.

<p>I will impute your total silence towards me for
many, many months to your preoccupation with the
work now announced, and will not believe that a greeting
from me at this time of the year will be less welcome
than of old. I remember that last year one of
your prettily-expressed wishes was that I should write
another book and&mdash;I think you added&mdash;send it to you
to read. On the strength of this remembrance, you
will be one of the three exceptional people to whom
we order "Middlemarch" to be sent. But do not
write to me about it, because until a book has quite
gone away from me and become entirely of the <em>non-ego</em>&mdash;gone
thoroughly from the wine-press into the casks&mdash;I
would rather not hear or see anything that is said
about it.</p>

<p>Cara sent me word that you were looking, as usual,
very pretty, and showing great energy on interesting
occasions. But this was two months ago, and some
detailed news from yourself would be a delightful gift.</p>

<p>I am getting stronger, and showing some meagre
benefit from being indulged in all possible ways. Mr.
Lewes makes a martyr of himself in writing all my
notes and business letters. Is not that being a sublime
husband? For all the while there are studies of
his own being put aside&mdash;studies which are a seventh
heaven to him.</p>

<p>Is there any one who does not need patience? For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
when one's outward lot is perfect, the sense of inward
imperfection is the more pressing.</p>

<p>You are never long without entering into my
thoughts, though you may send nothing fresh to feed
them. But I am ashamed of expressing regard for
my friends, since I do no earthly thing for them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara
Hennell,

1872.</div>

<p>A kiss to you on your birthday! with gratitude for
your delightful letter, such as only you can write me.
How impossible it is to <em>feel</em> that we are as old as we
are! Sometimes it seems a little while since you and
I were walking over the Radford fields, with the youth
in our limbs, talking and laughing with that easy companionship
which it is difficult to find in later life. I
am busy now reading Mr. Lewes's manuscript, which
has been accumulating fast during my "Middlemarch"
time. Did I tell you that in the last two years he has
been mastering the principles of mathematics? That
is an interesting fact, impersonally, at his age. Old
Professor Stowe&mdash;Mrs. H. B. Stowe's husband&mdash;sent
me this story, which is almost better than Topsy.
He heard a school-master asking a little black girl
the usual questions about creation&mdash;who made the
earth, the sea, etc. At last came, "And who made
you?" Some deliberation was necessary, after which
she said, "Nobody; <i>I was so afore</i>." Expect to be
immensely disappointed with the close of "Middlemarch."
But look back to the Prelude. I wish I
could take the wings of the morning every now and
then to cheer you with an hour's chat, such as you
feel the need of, and then fly back on the wings of
the wind. I have the most vivid thoughts of you, almost
like a bodily presence; but these do you no
good, since you can only believe that I have them&mdash;and
you are tired of believing after your work is done.

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
John
Blackwood,
1st
Dec. 1872.</div>

<p>Before your letter came, Mr. Lewes had been expressing
to me his satisfaction (and he is very hard
to satisfy with articles on me) in the genuineness of
judgment, wise moderation, and excellent selection of
points in "Maga's" review of "Middlemarch." I
have just now been reading the review myself&mdash;Mr.
Lewes had meant at first to follow his rule of not
allowing me to see what is written about myself&mdash;and
I am pleased to find the right moral note struck everywhere,
both in remark and quotation. Especially I
am pleased with the writer's sensibility to the pathos
in Mr. Casaubon's character and position, and with
the discernment he shows about Bulstrode. But it is
a perilous matter to approve the praise which is given
to our own doings.</p>

<p>I think that such an article as that which you hint
at on the tone of the Bar is very desirable. We are
usually at one on points of feeling. Is it not time
now to insist that ability and not lying is the force of
a barrister&mdash;that he has not to make himself a bad
actor in order to put a case well, but to get the clearness
and breadth of vision which will enable him to
handle the evidence effectively? Untruthfulness usually
ends by making men foolish. I have never read
"Spiritual Wives," but judging from the extracts
which have come before me, it must be a nasty book.
Still, if people will be censors, let them weigh their
words. I mean that the words were unfair by the disproportionateness
of the condemnation which everybody
with some conscience must feel to be one of the
great difficulties in denouncing a particular person.
Every unpleasant dog is only one of many, but we
kick him because he comes in our way, and there is
always some want of distributive justice in the kicking.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall be agreeably surprised if there is a respectable
subscription for the four volumes. Already the
numbers taken have been satisfactorily large, considering
the indisposition of the public to buy books by
comparison with other wares, and especially to buy
novels at a high price. I fancy every private copy
has done duty for a circle. Friends of mine in the
country have implied that they lent their copies to all
the readers in their neighborhood. A little fuss of
advertisement, together with the reviews, will perhaps
create a few more curious inquirers after the book,
and impress its existence on the slower part of the
reading world. But really the reading world is, after
all, very narrow, as, according to the <cite>Spectator</cite>, the
"comfortable" world also is&mdash;the world able to give
away a sovereign without pinching itself. Those
statistics just given about incomes are very interesting.</p>

imagine other people doing wise things than to do
them one's self! Practically, I excel in nothing but
paying twice as much as I ought for everything. On
the whole, it would be better if my life could be done
for me, and I could look on. However, it appears
that the question of the land at Shere may remain
open until we can discuss it with you at Weybridge;

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Congreve,
12th
Dec. 1872.</div>

<p>I have had the news that you are safely landed at
Pooree, so now I can write with some courage. I
have got some comfort&mdash;I trust it is not false comfort&mdash;out
of the probability that there will be much
good mingled with the evil of this winter's exile for
you. You must be the richer for it mentally, and your
health may be the better&mdash;and then, you will be back
again in the late spring. In this way I make myself
contented under the incompleteness of our life without
you, and I am determined not to grumble at my
share of the loss which falls so sadly on Dr. Congreve
and the children. Dr. Congreve kindly let me know
when you had got through the trials of the Red Sea,
rather better than might have been expected; and
Sophie tells me that you speak of the brilliant coloring
in your new world as quite equal to any description
you had read. Beyond that all is a blank to me
except the fact of your arrival at Pooree, and all my
feeling is taken up with the joy there must have been
in the meeting with Mr. Geddes. You find it very difficult
to write in the heat&mdash;so don't make the thought
of me disagreeable by associating it with a claim on
you for a letter. I will be grateful for scraps from
your correspondence with home, and wait for my turn
when you come back to us. For ourselves, we think
our little granddaughter, Blanche, the perfection of a
baby. She is, dispassionately speaking, very pretty,
and has a cooing, chanting song of her own which it
makes me happy to hear. Mr. Lewes goes on at his
writing with as much interest as ever, and is bringing
the first part of his work into its final shape. Since
we came home I have been reading his manuscript,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
which has been piling itself up in preparation for my
leisure, and I have been wearing my gravest philosophic
cap. Altogether we are dangerously happy.
You remember Mrs. Blank of Coventry? You know
hers was another name for astonishing cleverness in
that town. Now, of course, she is old, and her cleverness
seems to have a mouldy flavor. <i>Apropos</i> of
the seventh book of "Middlemarch"&mdash;which you may
not have read, but never mind&mdash;Mrs. Blank, having
lain awake all night from compassion for Bulstrode,
said, "Poor, dear creature, after he had done so much
for that wretch, sitting up at night and attending on
him! <i>and I don't believe it was the brandy that killed
him</i>&mdash;and what is to become of Bulstrode now, he has
nobody left but Christ!" I think this is worth sending
to India, you see; it is a little bit of old Coventry
life that may make you and Emily laugh with all the
more lively memory in the midst of your strange
scenery. But there is a hovering terror while I write
to you from far off, lest my trivialities should find
you when you are ill or have some cause for being
sad. In any case, however, you will take my letter
for a simple proof that I dwell on you and Emily as
images constantly present in my mind, and very often
moving to the foreground in my contemplation. Mr.
Lewes is one with me in many affectionate thoughts
about you, and your names are often on our lips.
We are going to pass the Christmas week with our
friends at Weybridge; and I shall be glad to escape
the London aspects of that season&mdash;aspects that are
without any happy association for me. Mr. Lewes
has just been in to speak to me, and begs me to say
that he hopes baby is raised to the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> power. You
see the lofty point of view from which he regards the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
world at present. But there is enough of the sap of
affection in him to withstand all the dryness of the
dryest mathematics, and he has very hearty regards
for you all, including Mr. Geddes, not as a matter of
course, but with special emphasis. Good-bye, dear,
dear friend. May it give you some little satisfaction
to think of me as yours always lovingly.</p>

<p>Your letter was very welcome to me. I wanted to
know how you were; and I think that I discern in
your words some growth of courage to face the hard
task&mdash;it is a hard task&mdash;of living a separate life. I
reckon it a great good to me that any writing of mine
has been taken into companionship by you, and seemed
to speak with you of your own experience. Thank

to be among friends who make a little claim on your
attention. When you go to How, please tell me all
about the place, and whom you have near you, because
I like to be able to imagine your circumstances.</p>

<p>I have been, and am still, reading Mr. Lewes's manuscript&mdash;and
I often associate this with your dear
husband, to whom I imagine mine would have liked
to send his proofs when the matter had reached the
printing stage.</p>

<p>We are both very well, and Mr. Lewes is enjoying
his morning at his desk. He likes very much to be
included in your love, and has always thought you one
of the most charming women among our acquaintance.
Please not to say that he has bad taste in
women. We both cherish very tender thoughts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
your sorrow, dear friend. Let me always be assured
that you think of me as yours affectionately.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mr. Simpson,

Dec. 1872.</div>

<p>We have to thank you for two things especially.
First, for the good bargain you have made for "Middlemarch"
with Australia; and secondly, for the trouble
you have kindly taken with the MS., which has
come to us safely in its fine Russian coat.</p>

<p>The four volumes, we imagine, must have been subscribed
long ago; and we should be glad to know, if
it were convenient&mdash;perhaps even if it were <em>in</em>convenient&mdash;what
are the figures representing the courage
of "the trade" in the matter of a 42<i>s.</i> novel, which
has already been well distributed.</p>

<p>We both hope that your health is well confirmed,
and that you are prepared for Christmas pleasures,
among which you would probably, like Caleb Garth,
reckon the extra "business" which the jolly season
carries in its hinder wallet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Journal,
1873.</div>

<p><i>Jan. 1.</i>&mdash;At the beginning of December the eighth
and last book of "Middlemarch" was published, the
three final numbers having been published monthly.
No former book of mine has been received with more
enthusiasm&mdash;not even "Adam Bede;" and I have received
many deeply affecting assurances of its influence
for good on individual minds. Hardly anything
could have happened to me which I could regard as a
greater blessing than the growth of my spiritual existence
when my bodily existence is decaying. The
merely egoistic satisfactions of fame are easily nullified
by toothache, and <em>that</em> has made my chief consciousness
for the last week. This morning, when I
was in pain, and taking a melancholy breakfast in bed,
some sweet-natured creature sent a beautiful bouquet
to the door for me, bound round with the written wish
that "Every year may be happier and happier, and
that God's blessing may ever abide with the immortal
author of 'Silas Marner.'" Happily my dear husband
is well, and able to enjoy these things for me. That
he rejoices in them is my most distinct personal pleasure
in such tributes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John
Blackwood,
3d
Jan. 1873.</div>

<p>It was very pleasant to have your greeting on the
New Year, though I was keeping its advent in melancholy
guise. I am relieved now from the neuralgic
part of my ailment, and am able to write something
of the hearty response I feel to your good wishes.</p>

<p>We both hope that the coming year may continue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
to you all the family joys which must make the core
of your happiness, without underrating golf and good
contributors to "Maga." Health has to be presupposed
as the vehicle of all other good, and in this respect
you may be possibly better off in '73 than in '72, for
I think you have had several invalidings within the
last twelve months.</p>

<p>Mr. Langford wrote yesterday that he knew of an
article on "Middlemarch" being in preparation for
the <cite>Times</cite>, which certainly was never before so slow in
noticing a book of mine. Whether such an article
will affect the sale favorably seems eminently uncertain,
and can only complicate Mr. Simpson's problem.</p>

<p>We have been glad to welcome our good friend, Mr.
Anthony Trollope, after his long absence. He is wonderfully
full of life and energy, and will soon bring out
his two thick volumes on Australian colonies.</p>

<p>My friendly Dutch publishers lately sent us a handsome
row of volumes&mdash;George Eliot's "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Romantische
Werke</span>," with an introduction, in which comparisons
are safely shrouded for me in the haze of Dutch, so
that if they are disadvantageous, I am not pained.</p>

<p>Please give my best wishes for the coming year to
Mr. William Blackwood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Cross,
4th Jan.
1873.</div>

<p>At last I break my silence, and thank you for your
kind care about me. I am able to enjoy my reading
at the corner of my study fire, and am at that unpitiable
stage of illness which is counterbalanced by extra
petting. I have been fearing that you too may be undergoing
some <i>malaise</i> of a kindred sort, and I should
like to be assured that you have quite got through the
troubles which threatened you.</p>

<p>How good you have all been to me, and what a disappointing
investment of affection I have turned out!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
But those evening drives, which perhaps encouraged
the faceache, have left me a treasure of picture and
poetry in my memory quite worth paying for, and in
these days all prices are high.</p>

<p>The new year began very prettily for me at half-past
eight in the morning with a beautiful bouquet, left by
an unknown at our door, and an inscription asking that
"God's blessing might ever abide with the immortal
author of 'Silas Marner.'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John
Blackwood,
25th
Feb. 1873.</div>

<p>I am much pleased with the color and the lettering
of the guinea edition, and the thinner paper makes it
delightfully handy. Let us hope that some people still
want to read it, since a friend of ours, in one short railway
bit to and fro, saw two persons reading the paper-covered
numbers. Now is the moment when a notice
in the <cite>Times</cite> might possibly give a perceptible impulse.</p>

<p>Kohn, of Berlin, has written to ask us to allow him
to reprint the "Spanish Gypsy" for £50, and we have
consented. Some Dresdener, who has translated poems
of Tennyson's, asked leave to translate the "Spanish
Gypsy" in 1870, but I have not heard of his translation
appearing.</p>

<p>The rain this morning is welcome, in exchange for
the snow, which in London has none of its country
charms left to it. Among my books, which comfort
me in the absence of sunshine, is a copy of the
"Handy Royal Atlas" which Mr. Lewes has got for
me. The glorious index is all the more appreciable
by me, because I am tormented with German historical
atlases which have no index, and are covered with
names swarming like ants on every map.</p>

<p>The catalogue coming in the other day renewed my
longing for the cheap edition of Lockhart's novels,
though I have some compunction in teasing your busy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
mind with my small begging. I should like to take
them into the country, where our days are always
longer for reading.</p>

<p>I have a love for Lockhart because of Scott's Life,
which seems to me a perfect biography. How different
from another we know of!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John
Blackwood,
28th
Feb. 1873.</div>

<p>After your kind words I will confess that I should
very much like to have the "Manual of Geography"
by Mackay, and Bayne's "Port Royal Logic."</p>

<p><i>À propos</i> of the "Lifted Veil," I think it will not be
judicious to reprint it at present. I care for the idea
which it embodies and which justifies its painfulness.
A motto which I wrote on it yesterday perhaps is a
sufficient indication of that idea:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Give me no light, great heaven, but such as turns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To energy of human fellowship;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No powers, save the growing heritage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That makes completer manhood."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But it will be well to put the story in harness with
some other productions of mine, and not send it forth
in its dismal loneliness. There are many things in it
which I would willingly say over again, and I shall
never put them in any other form. But we must wait a
little. The question is not in the least one of money,
but of care for the best effect of writing, which often
depends on circumstances, much as pictures depend
on light and juxtaposition.</p>

<p>I am looking forward with interest to "Kenelm
Chillingly," and thinking what a blessed lot it is to
die on just finishing a book, if it could be a good one.
I mean, it is blessed only to quit activity when one
quits life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Wm.
Smith, 1st
Mch. 1873.</div>

<p>If I had been quite sure of your address I should
have written to you even before receiving your dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
letter, over which I have been crying this morning.
The prompting to write to you came from my having
ten days ago read your Memoir&mdash;brief yet full&mdash;of the
precious last months before the parting. Mrs. P. Taylor
brought me her copy as a loan. But may I not
beg to have a copy of my own? It is to me an invaluable
bit of writing; the inspiration of a great sorrow,
born of a great love, has made it perfect; and
ever since I read it I have felt a strengthening companionship
from it. You will perhaps think it strange
when I tell you that I have been more cheerful since
I read the record of his sweet, mild heroism, which
threw emphasis on every blessing left in his waning
life, and was silent over its pangs. I have even ventured
to lend this copy, which is not my own, to a
young married woman of whom I am very fond, because
I think it is an unforgetable picture of that
union which is the ideal of marriage, and which
I desire young people to have in their minds as a
goal.</p>

<p>It is a comfort in thinking of you that you have two
lovable young creatures with you. I have found quite
a new interest in young people since I have been conscious
that I am getting older; and if all personal joy
were to go from me as it has gone from you, I could
perhaps find some energy from that interest, and try
to teach the young. I wish, dear friend, it were possible
to convey to you the sense I have of a great good
in being permitted to know of your happiness, and of
having some communion with the sorrow which is its
shadow. Your words have a consecration for me, and
my husband shares my feeling. He sends his love
along with mine. He sobbed with something which is
a sort of grief better worth having than any trivial gladness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
as he read the printed record of your love. He,
too, is capable of that supreme, self-merging love.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John
Blackwood,
14th
Mch. 1873.</div>

<p>This is good news about the guinea edition, but I
emphatically agree with you that it will be well to be
cautious in further printing. I wish you could see a
letter I had from California the other day, apparently
from a young fellow, and beginning, "Oh, you dear
lady! I who have been a Fred Vincy ever so long ... have
played vagabond and ninny ever since I
knew the meaning of such terms," etc., etc.</p>

<p>I am sorry to infer, from what you say about being
recommended to go to a German bath, that you have
been out of health lately. There really is a good deal
of curative virtue in the air, waters, and exercise one
gets at such places, and if the boredom were not strong
enough to counteract the better influences, it would be
worth while to endure.</p>

<p>That phrase of Miss Stuart's&mdash;"fall flat on the
world"&mdash;is worth remembering. I should think it is
not likely to prove prophetic, if she is at all like her
cousin, whose fair, piquant face remains very vividly
before me. The older one gets, the more one delights
in these young things, rejoicing in their joys.</p>

<p>The ministerial crisis interests me, though it does
not bring me any practical need for thinking of it, as it
does to you. I wish there were some solid, philosophical
Conservative to take the reins&mdash;one who knows
the true functions of stability in human affairs, and, as
the psalm says, "Would also practice what he knows."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Edward
Burne-Jones,
20th
Mch. 1873.</div>

<p>I suppose my hesitation about writing to you to tell
you of a debt I feel towards you is all vanity. If you
did not know me, you might think a great deal more
of my judgment than it is worth, and I should feel bold
in that possibility. But when judgment is understood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to mean simply one's own impression of delight, one
ought not to shrink from making one's small offering
of burnt clay because others can give gold statues.</p>

<p>It would be narrowness to suppose that an artist can
only care for the impressions of those who know the
methods of his art as well as feel its effects. Art
works for all whom it can touch. And I want in gratitude
to tell you that your work makes life larger and
more beautiful to me. I mean that historical life of all
the world, in which our little personal share often
seems a mere standing-room from which we can look
all round, and chiefly backward. Perhaps the work has
a strain of special sadness in it&mdash;perhaps a deeper
sense of the tremendous outer forces which urge us,
than of the inner impulse towards heroic struggle and
achievement&mdash;but the sadness is so inwrought with
pure, elevating sensibility to all that is sweet and
beautiful in the story of man and in the face of the
earth that it can no more be found fault with than the
sadness of mid-day, when Pan is touchy, like the rest
of us. Don't you agree with me that much superfluous
stuff is written on all sides about purpose in art? A
nasty mind makes nasty art, whether for art or any
other sake; and a meagre mind will bring forth what
is meagre. And some effect in determining other
minds there must be, according to the degree of nobleness
or meanness in the selection made by the artist's
soul.</p>

<p>Your work impresses me with the happy sense of
noble selection and of power determined by refined
sympathy. That is why I wanted to thank you in writing,
since lip-homage has fallen into disrepute.</p>

<p>I cannot help liking to tell you a sign that my delight
must have taken a little bit of the same curve as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
yours. Looking, <i>à propos</i> of your picture, into the
"Iphigenia in Aulis," to read the chorus you know of,
I found my blue pencil-marks made seven years ago
(and gone into that forgetfulness which makes my mind
seem very large and empty)&mdash;blue pencil-marks made
against the dance&mdash;loving Kithara and the footsteps
of the muses and the nereids dancing on the shining
sands. I was pleased to see that my mind had been
touched in a dumb way by what has touched yours to
fine utterance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Congreve,
15th
April, 1873</div>

<p>Welcome back to Europe! What a comfort to see
your handwriting dated from San Remo&mdash;to think that
Dr. Congreve's anxieties about your voyage are at an
end, and that you are once more in the post which is
more specially and permanently yours! Mr. Lewes
finds fault with your letter for not telling enough; but
the mere fact of your safety seems to fill it quite full
for me, and I can think of no drawbacks&mdash;not even
of the cold, which I hope is by this time passing away
for you, as it is for us. You must be so rich in memories
that we and our small ordinary news must appear
very flat to you, but we will submit to be a little
despised by you if only we can have you with us
again. I have never lost the impression of Dr. Congreve's
look when he paid us his farewell visit, and
spoke of his anxiety about your voyage, fearing that
you had started too late; and that impression gives
me all the keener sympathy with the repose I trust
he is feeling. About ourselves I have only good news
to tell. We are happier than ever, and have no troubles.
We are searching for a country-house to go to at the
end of May or earlier. I long for the perfect peace
and freedom of the country again. The hours seem
to stretch themselves there, and to hold twice as much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
thought as one can get into them in town, where acquaintances
and small claims inevitably multiply.</p>

<p>Imagine us nearly as we were when we last saw you&mdash;only
a little older&mdash;with unchanged affection for
you and undimmed interest in whatever befalls you.
Do not tax yourself to write unless you feel a pleasure
in that imperfect sort of communication. I will try
not to fear evil if you are silent, but you know that I
am glad to have something more than hope to feed
on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Wm.
Smith, 25th
April, 1873.</div>

<p>It was a cordial to me this morning to learn that
you have the project of going with your young friend
to Cambridge at the end of the autumn. I could not
have thought of anything better to wish for on your
behalf than that you should have the consciousness
of helping a younger life. I know, dear friend, that
so far as you directly are concerned with this life the
remainder of it can only be patience and resignation.
But we are not shut up within our individual life, and
it is one of the gains of advancing age that the good
of young creatures becomes a more definite, intense
joy to us. With that renunciation for ourselves which
age inevitably brings, we get more freedom of soul to
enter into the life of others; what we can never learn
they will know, and the gladness which is a departed
sunlight to us is rising with the strength of morning to
them.</p>

<p>I am very much interested in the fact of young
women studying at Cambridge, and I have lately seen
a charming specimen of the pupils at Hitchin&mdash;a very
modest, lovely girl, who distinguished herself in the
last examination. One is anxious that, in the beginning
of a higher education for women&mdash;the immediate
value of which is chiefly the social recognition of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
desirableness&mdash;the students should be favorable subjects
for experiment, girls or young women whose natures
are large and rich enough not to be used up in
their efforts after knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes is very well and goes on working joyously.
Proofs come in slowly, but he is far from being
ready with all the manuscript which will be needed
for his preliminary volume&mdash;the material, which has
long been gathered, requiring revision and suggesting
additions.</p>

<p>Do think it a privilege to have that fine <i>physique</i> of
yours instead of a headachy, dyspeptic frame such as
many women drag through life. Even in irremediable
sorrow it is a sort of blasphemy against one's suffering
fellow-beings to think lightly of any good which they
would be thankful for in exchange for something they
have to bear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Journal,

<p><i>May 19.</i>&mdash;We paid a visit to Cambridge at the invitation
of Mr. Frederick Myers, and I enjoyed greatly
talking with him and some others of the "Trinity
Men." In the evenings we went to see the boat-race,
and then returned to supper and talk&mdash;the first evening
with Mr. Henry Sidgwick, Mr. Jebb, Mr. Edmund
Gurney; the second, with young Balfour, young Lyttelton,
Mr. Jackson, and Edmund Gurney again. Mrs.
and Miss Huth were also our companions during the
visit. On the Tuesday morning we breakfasted at Mr.
Henry Sidgwick's with Mr. Jebb, Mr. W. G. Clark, Mr.
Myers, and Mrs. and Miss Huth.</p>

<p><i>May 22.</i>&mdash;We went to the French play at the Princess's
and saw Plessy and Desclée in "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Idées de
Madame Aubray</span>." I am just finishing again Aristotle's
"Poetics," which I first read in 1856.</p>

<p>Our plans have been upset by the impossibility of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
finding a house in the country that is suitable to us,
and weariness of being deluded into journeys of investigation
by fanciful advertisements has inclined Mr.
Lewes for the present to say that we will go abroad.
Still, I have nothing to tell that is absolutely settled,
and I must ask you, when you return, to send a note
to this house. If I am in England it will be forwarded
to me, and you will get a prompt answer. If I am
silent you will conclude that I am gone abroad. I
think it is at the end of June that you are to come
home?</p>

<p>Here we have been wearing furs and velvet, and
having fires all through the past week, chiefly occupied
by Mr. Lewes and me in a visit to Cambridge.
We were invited ostensibly to see the boat-race, but
the real pleasure of the visit consisted in talking with
a hopeful group of Trinity young men. On Monday
we had a clear, cold day, more like the fine weather
of mid-winter than any tradition of May time. I hope
that you have had no such revisiting of winter at San
Remo. How much we should enjoy having you with
us to narrate everything that has happened to you in
the last eventful half year! I shall feel the loss of
this, as an immediate prospect, to be the greatest disadvantage
in our going abroad next month&mdash;if we go.</p>

<p>Your last news of Emily and of "baby's teeth" is
cheerful. "Baby's teeth" is a phrase that enters
much into our life just now. Little Blanche had a
sad struggle with her first little bit of ivory, but she
has been blooming again since, and is altogether a
ravishing child. To-day we have had a large collection
of visitors, and I have the usual Sunday evening
condition of brain. But letters are so constantly coming
and claiming my time to answer them, that I get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
fidgety lest I should neglect to write to you; and I
was determined not to let another day pass without
letting you have a proof that I think of you. When I
am silent please believe that the silence is due to feebleness
of body, which narrows my available time.
Mr. Lewes often talks of you, and will value any word
from you about yourself as much as I shall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>Thanks for sending me word of poor Miss Rebecca
Franklin's death. It touches me deeply. She was

had much happiness in her as my teacher.</p>

<p>In September a house near Chislehurst will be open
to us&mdash;a house which we think of ultimately making

<p><i>June.</i>&mdash;In the beginning of June we paid a visit to
Mr. Jowett at Oxford, meeting there Mr. and Mrs.
Charles Roundell, then newly married. We stayed
from Saturday to Monday, and I was introduced to
many persons of interest. Professor T. Green, Max
Müller, Thomson, the Master of Trinity College, Cambridge,
a Mr. Wordsworth, the grandson of the poet,
who had spent some time in India, and a host of
others.</p>

Plombières, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I feel myself guilty that I have allowed the vicissitudes
of travelling to hinder me from writing to you,
for the chance that a letter from me might be welcome
to you in what I have been imagining as the first
weeks of your return to England and the house in
Mecklenburgh Square. I am sure that I should not
have been guilty in this way if I had been at any time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
able to say where you should send me an answer
which I could call for at a <i>Poste Restante</i>. But we
have been invariably uncertain as to the length of our
stay in any one place and as to our subsequent route;
and I confess that I shrink from writing a letter full
of my own doings, without the prospect of getting
some news in return. I am usually in a state of fear
rather than of hope about my absent friends; and I
dread lest a letter written in ignorance about them
should be ill-timed. But at last all fears have become
weaker than the uneasy sense that I have omitted to
send you a sign of your loved presence in my thoughts,
and that you may have lost a gleam of pleasure through
my omission.</p>

<p>We left home on the 23d of June, with a sketch of a
journey in our minds, which included Grenoble, the
Grande Chartreuse, Aix-les-Bains, Chambéry, and Geneva.
The last place I wished to get to, because my
friend Mme. d'Albert is not likely to live much longer,
and I thought that I should like to see her once more.
But during a short stay at Fontainebleau I began to
feel that lengthy railway journeys were too formidable
for us old, weak creatures, and, moreover, that
July and August were not the best months for those
southern regions. We were both shattered, and needed
quiet rather than the excitement of seeing friends
and acquaintances&mdash;an excitement of which we had
been having too much at home&mdash;so we turned aside
by easy stages to the Vosges, and spent about three
weeks at Plombières and Luxeuil. We shall carry
home many pleasant memories of our journey&mdash;of
Fontainebleau, for example, which I had never seen
before. Then of the Vosges, where we count on going
again. Erckmann-Chatrian's books had been an introduction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
to the lovely region; and several of them were
our companions there. But what small experiences
these are compared with yours; and how we long for
the time when you will be seated with us at our country-house
(Blackbrook, near Bromley, is the name of
the house), and tell us as much as you can think of
about this long year in which we have been deprived
of you. If you receive this letter in time to write me
a line, which would reach me by the 15th, I shall be
most grateful if you will give me that undeserved indulgence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter

Blackwood,

Aug. 1873.</div>

<p>On our return yesterday from our nine-weeks' absence
I found a letter from Mr. Main, in which he
shows some anxiety that I should write you the "formal
sanction" you justly require before admitting extracts
from "Middlemarch" in the new edition of the
"Sayings." I have no objection, if you see none, to
such an enlargement of the volume, and I satisfy our
good Mr. Main's promptitude by writing the needed
consent at once.</p>

<p>We used our plan of travel as "a good thing to
wander from," and went to no single place (except
Fontainebleau) to which we had beforehand projected
going.</p>

<p>Our most fortunate wandering was to the Vosges&mdash;to
Plombières and Luxeuil&mdash;which have made us
in love with the mode of life at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eaux</i> of France,
as greatly preferable to the ways of the German <i>Bad</i>.</p>

<p>We happened to be at Nancy just as the Germans
were beginning to quit it, and we saw good store of
<i>tricolores</i> and paper lanterns ready in the shop windows
for those who wished to buy the signs of national
rejoicing. I can imagine that, as a Prussian lady told
us, the Germans themselves were not at all rejoiced to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
leave that pretty town for "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les bords de la Spree</span>," where,
in French dialogue, all Germans are supposed to live.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Cross,
17th Sept.
1873.</div>

<p>Thanks, dear friend, for the difficult exertion you
gave to the telling of what I so much wished to know&mdash;the
details of the trouble<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
which you have all had
to go through either directly or sympathetically. But
I will not dwell now on what it cost you, I fear, too
much pain to recall so as to give me the vivid impressions
I felt in reading your letter. The great practical
result of such trouble is to make us all more tender to
each other; this is a world in which we must pay heavy
prices for love, as you know by experience much deeper
than mine.</p>

<p>I will gossip a little about ourselves now. We gave
up our intention of going far southward, fearing the
fatigue of long railway journeys, and the heat (which
hardly ever came) of July and August in the region we
had thought of visiting. So, after staying a very enjoyable
time at Fontainebleau, we went to the Vosges,
and at Plombières and Luxeuil we should have felt
ourselves in paradise if it had not been for a sad deafness
of George's, which kept us uneasy and made us
hurry to that undesirable place, Frankfort, in order to
consult Spiess. At Frankfort the nearest bath was
the also undesirable Homburg; so we spent or wasted
a fortnight there, winning little but the joy of getting
away again. The journey home, which we took very
easily, was interesting&mdash;through Metz, Verdun, Rheims,
and Amiens.</p>

<p>As to our house, spite of beautiful lawn, tall trees,
fine kitchen-garden, and good, invigorating air, we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
already made up our minds that it will not do for our
home. Still, we have many things to enjoy, but we
shall not probably remain here longer than to the end
of October.</p>

<p>My motherly love to all such young ones as may be
around you. I do not disturb George in order to ask
for messages from him, being sure that his love goes
with mine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter

<p>I quite assent to your proposal that there should be
a new edition of "Middlemarch" in one volume, at
7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&mdash;to be prepared at once, but not published too
precipitately.</p>

<p>I like your project of an illustration; and the financial
arrangements you mention are quite acceptable to
me.</p>

<p>For one reason especially I am delighted that the
book is going to be reprinted&mdash;namely, <i>that I can see
the proof-sheets and make corrections</i>. Pray give orders
that the sheets be sent to me. I should like the binding
to be of a rich, sober color, with very plain Roman
lettering. It might be called a "revised edition."</p>

<p>Thanks for the extract from Mr. Collins's letter. I
did not know that there was really a Lowick, in a Midland
county too. Mr. Collins has my gratitude for
feeling some regard towards Mr. Casaubon, in whose
life <em>I</em> lived with much sympathy.</p>

<p>When I was at Oxford, in May, two ladies came up
to me after dinner: one said, "How could you let
Dorothea marry <em>that</em> Casaubon?" The other, "Oh, I
understand her doing that, but why did you let her
marry the other fellow, whom I cannot bear?" Thus
two "ardent admirers" wished that the book had been
quite different from what it is.</p>

<p>I wonder whether you have abandoned&mdash;as you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
seemed to agree that it would be wise to do&mdash;the project
of bringing out my other books in a cheaper form
than the present 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, which, if it were not for the
blemish of the figure illustrations, would be as pretty
an edition as could be, and perhaps as cheap as my
public requires. Somehow, the cheap books that
crowd the stalls are always those which look as if they
were issued from Pandemonium.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Cross,

<p>I am rather ashamed of our grumblings. We are
really enjoying the country, and have more than our
share of everything. George has happy mornings at
his desk now, and we have fine bracing air to walk in&mdash;air
which I take in as a sort of nectar. We like the
bits of scenery round us better and better as we get
them by heart in our walks and drives. The house,
with all its defects, is very pretty, and more delightfully
secluded, without being remote from the conveniences
of the world, than any place we have before
thought of as a possible residence for us.</p>

<p>I am glad that you have been seeing the Cowper
Temples. My knowledge of them has not gone beyond
dining with them at Mrs. Tollemache's, and afterwards
having a good conversational call from them,
but they both struck me very agreeably.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Sidgwick is a chief favorite of mine&mdash;one
of whom his friends at Cambridge say that they always
expect him to act according to a higher standard than
they think of attributing to any other chief man, or of
imposing on themselves. "Though we kept our own
fellowships without believing more than he did," one
of them said to me, "we should have felt that Henry
Sidgwick had fallen short if he had not renounced
his."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>Our plan is not to give up our London house, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to have a country place as a retreat. We want a good
house in a lovely country, <em>away from rows of villas</em>, but
within easy reach of all conveniences. This seems an
immodest requirement in a world where one good is
hardly to be got without renunciation of another. You
perceive that we are getting very old and fastidious.</p>

<p>I like to interpret your enjoyment of Brighton and
its evening skies as a proof that you flourish there
physically. All things are to be endured and counted
even as a fuller life, with a body free from pain and
depressing sensations of weakness; but illness is a partial
death, and makes the world dim to us.</p>

<p>We have no great strength to boast of; but we are
so unspeakably happy in all other respects that we
cannot grumble at this tax on us as elderly mortals.</p>

<p>Our little Blanche grows in grace, and her parents
have great delight in her&mdash;Charles being quite as
fond a father as if he had beforehand been an idolizer
of babies.</p>

<p>The chances of conversation were against my being
quite clear to you yesterday as to the cases in which
it seems to me that conformity is the higher rule.
What happened to be said or not said is of no consequence
in any other light than that of my anxiety
not to appear what I should <em>hate to be</em>&mdash;which is surely
not an ignoble, egoistic anxiety, but belongs to the
worship of the Best.</p>

<p>All the great religions of the world, historically considered,
are rightly the objects of deep reverence and
sympathy&mdash;they are the record of spiritual struggles,
which are the types of our own. This is to me pre-eminently
true of Hebrewism and Christianity, on which
my own youth was nourished. And in this sense I
have no antagonism towards any religious belief, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
a strong outflow of sympathy. Every community met
to worship the highest Good (which is understood to
be expressed by God) carries me along in its main
current; and if there were not reasons against my
following such an inclination, I should go to church
or chapel constantly for the sake of the delightful emotions
of fellowship which come over me in religious
assemblies&mdash;the very nature of such assemblies being
the recognition of a binding belief or spiritual law,
which is to lift us into willing obedience and save us
from the slavery of unregulated passion or impulse.
And with regard to other people, it seems to me that
those who have no definite conviction which constitutes
a protesting faith may often more beneficially cherish
the good within them and be better members of society
by a conformity, based on the recognized good in the
public belief, than by a nonconformity which has nothing
but negatives to utter. <em>Not</em>, of course, if the conformity
would be accompanied by a consciousness of
hypocrisy. That is a question for the individual conscience
to settle. But there is enough to be said on
the different points of view from which conformity may
be regarded to hinder a ready judgment against those
who continue to conform after ceasing to believe, in
the ordinary sense. But with the utmost largeness of
allowance for the difficulty of deciding in special cases,
it must remain true that the highest lot is to have
definite beliefs about which you feel that "necessity
is laid upon you" to declare them, as something better
which you are bound to try and give to those who have
the worse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John
Blackwood,

Nov. 1873.</div>

<p>It was a cheerful accompaniment to breakfast this
morning to have a letter from you, with the pretty
picture you suggested of Miss Blackwood's first ball.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
I am glad that I have seen the "little fairy," so as to
be able to imagine her.</p>

<p>We are both the better for the delicious air and quiet
of the country. We, too, like you, were sorry to quit
the woods and fields for the comparatively disturbed
life which even we are obliged to lead in town. Letters
requesting interviews can no longer be made void
by one's absence; and I am much afflicted by these
interruptions, which break up the day without any adequate
result of good to any mortal. In the country
the days have broad spaces, and the very stillness
seems to give a delightful roominess to the hours.</p>

<p>Is it not wonderful that the world can absorb so
much "Middlemarch" at a guinea the copy? I shall
be glad to hear particulars, which, I imagine, will lead
to the conclusion that the time is coming for the preparation
of a 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> edition. I am not fond of reading
proofs, but I am anxious to correct the sheets of this
edition, both in relation to mistakes already standing,
and to prevent the accumulation of others in the reprinting.</p>

<p>I am slowly simmering towards another big book;
but people seem so bent on giving supremacy to "Middlemarch"
that they are sure not to like any future
book so well. I had a letter from Mr. Bancroft (the
American ambassador at Berlin) the other day, in
which he says that everybody in Berlin reads "Middlemarch."
He had to buy two copies for his house;
and he found the rector of the university, a stupendous
mathematician, occupied with it in the solid part
of the day. I am entertaining you in this graceful way
about myself because you will be interested to know
what are the chances for our literature abroad.</p>

<p>That Ashantee business seems to me hideous.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
What is more murderous than stupidity? To have
a husband gone on such an expedition is a trial that
passes my imagination of what it is possible to endure
in the way of anxiety.</p>

<p>We are looking forward to the "Inkerman" volume
as something for me to read aloud.</p>

<p>During the latter part of our stay at Blackbrook we
had become very fond of the neighborhood. The
walks and drives round us were delightfully varied&mdash;commons,
wooded lanes, wide pastures&mdash;and we felt
regretfully that we were hardly likely to find again a
country-house so secluded in a well-inhabited region.</p>

<p>We have seen few people at present. The George
Howards are come from a delicious, lonely <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">séjour</i> in a
tower of Bamborough Castle!&mdash;and he has brought
many sketches home. That lodging would suit you,
wouldn't it? A castle on a rock washed by the sea
seems to me just a paradise for you.</p>

<p>We have been reading John Mill's "Autobiography,"
like the rest of the world. The account of his

admirable; but there are some pages in the latter half

<p>Our wish to see you after all the long months since

for Mr. Lewes&mdash;ordering him to renounce the coffee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
which has been a chief charm of life to him, but being
otherwise mild in his prohibitions.</p>

one loves well in spite of long separation. I am
very glad to have seen you in your new home, and to
be able to imagine you among your household treasures&mdash;especially
to imagine both you and your husband

lately, and have put ourselves under the discipline of
Dr. Andrew Clark, who is not one of the "three meat-meals
and alcohol" physicians, but rather one of those
who try to starve out dyspepsia.</p>

<p>We both send our kind regards to Mr. Taylor, and

<p><i>Jan. 1.</i>&mdash;The happy old year, in which we have had
constant enjoyment of life, notwithstanding much bodily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
<i>malaise</i>, is gone from us forever. More than in any
former year of my life love has been poured forth to
me from distant hearts, and in our home we have had
that finish to domestic comfort which only faithful, kind
servants can give. Our children are prosperous and
happy&mdash;Charles evidently growing in mental efficiency;
we have abundant wealth for more than our actual
needs; and our unspeakable joy in each other has no
other alloy than the sense that it must one day end in
parting. My dear husband has a store of present and
prospective good in the long work which is likely to
stretch through the remaining years of his intellectual
activity; and there have not been wanting signs that
what he has already published is being appreciated
rightly by capable persons. He is thinner than ever,
but still he shows wonderful elasticity and nervous energy.
I have been for a month rendered almost helpless
for intellectual work by constant headache, but
am getting a little more freedom. Nothing is wanting
to my blessings but the uninterrupted power of work.
For as to all my unchangeable imperfections I have
resigned myself.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 17.</i>&mdash;I received this morning, from Blackwood,
the account of "Middlemarch" and of "The Spanish
Gypsy" for 1873. Of the guinea edition of "Middlemarch,"
published in the spring, 2434 copies have been
sold. Of "The Spanish Gypsy" 292 copies have been
sold during 1873, and the remaining copies are only
197. Thus, out of 4470 which have been printed, 4273
have been distributed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Wm.

<p>We have received the volume&mdash;your kind and valuable
gift&mdash;and I have read it aloud with Mr. Lewes,
all except the later pages, which we both feel too much
to bear reading them in common. You have given a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
deeply interesting and, we think, instructive picture,
and Mr. Lewes has expressed his wish that it had not
been restricted to a private circulation. But I understand
your shrinking from indiscriminate publicity, at
least in the first instance. Perhaps, if many judges on
whom you rely concur with Mr. Lewes, you will be induced
to extend the possible benefit of the volume. I
care so much for the demonstration of an intense joy
in life on the basis of "plain living and high thinking"
in this time of more and more eager scrambling
after wealth and show. And then there are exquisite
bits which you have rescued from that darkness to
which his self-depreciation condemned them. I think
I never read a more exquisite little poem than the one
called "Christian Resignation;" and Mr. Lewes, when
I read it aloud, at once exclaimed, "How very fine&mdash;read
it again!" I am also much impressed with the
wise mingling of moderation with sympathy in that
passage, given in a note, from the article on Greg's
"Political Essays."</p>

<p>What must have been the effort which the writing
cost you I can&mdash;not fully, but almost&mdash;imagine. But
believe, dear friend, that in our judgment you have not
poured out these recollections in a cry of anguish all
in vain. I feel roused and admonished by what you
have told, and if I&mdash;then others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
John
Blackwood, 20th
Feb. 1874.</div>

<p>I imagined you absorbed by the political crisis, like
the rest of the world except the Lord Chief-justice, who
must naturally have felt his summing-up deserving of
more attention. I, who am no believer in salvation
by ballot, am rather tickled that the first experiment
with it has turned against its adherents.</p>

<p>I have been making what will almost certainly be
my last corrections of the "Spanish Gypsy," and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
causes me to look forward with special satisfaction to
the probable exhaustion of the present edition. The
corrections chiefly concern the quantity of the word
Zincálo, which ought to be Zíncalo; but there are some
other emendations; and, altogether, they make a difference
to more than seventy pages. But it would still
be worth while to retain the stereotypes, replacing simply
the amended pages, there being about 400 in the
whole book. I am sadly vexed that I did not think
of having these corrections ready for the German reprint.</p>

<p>I have been compunctious lately about my having
sprinkled cold water on the proposal suggested by
Mr. Simpson, of bringing out my novels in a cheaper
way&mdash;on thinner paper and without illustrations. The
compunction was roused by my happening, in looking
at old records, to alight on some letters, one especially,
written by a working-man, a certain E.
Hall,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
more
than ten years ago, begging me to bring out my books
in a form cheap enough to let a poor man more easily
"get a read of them." Hence, if you and Mr. Simpson
see good to revive the design in question, I am perfectly
in accord.</p>

<p>You did send me a copy of Lord Lytton's "Fables"&mdash;many
thanks for doing so. Mr. Lewes had seen
several of them in manuscript, and thought well of
their merits. I am reading them gradually. They
are full of graceful fancies and charming verse. So
far as cleverness goes it seems to me he can do almost
anything; and the leanings of his mind are towards
the best things. The want I feel is of more definiteness
and more weight. The two stanzas to his
wife, placed before "Far and Near," are perfect.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<p>I think I have never written to you since I wanted
to tell you that I admired very much the just spirit in
which the notice of Mill's "Autobiography" was written
in the Magazine. Poor Dickens's latter years wear
a melancholy aspect, do they not? But some of the
extracts from his letters in the last volume have surprisingly
more freshness and naturalness of humor
than any of the letters earlier given. Still, something
should be done by dispassionate criticism towards the
reform of our national habits in the matter of literary
biography. Is it not odious that as soon as a man is
dead his desk is raked, and every insignificant memorandum
which he never meant for the public is printed
for the gossiping amusement of people too idle to re-read
his books? "He gave the people of his best.
His worst he kept, his best he gave;" but there is a
certain set, not a small one, who are titillated by the
worst and indifferent to the best. I think this fashion
is a disgrace to us all. It is something like the uncovering
of the dead Byron's club-foot.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes is in a more flourishing condition than
usual, having been helped by Dr. Andrew Clark, who
ministers to all the brain-workers. I have been ill
lately: weeks of <i>malaise</i> having found their climax in
lumbar-neuralgia, or something of that sort, which gave
fits of pain severe enough to deserve even a finer name.</p>

<p>My writing has not been stimulated as Scott's was
under circumstances of a like sort, and I have nothing
to tell you securely.</p>

<p>Please give an expression of my well-founded sympathy
to Mr. William Blackwood. My experience
feelingly convinces me of the hardship there must be
in his. I trust I shall hear of the lameness as a departed
evil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter

<p>I send you by this post a small collection of my poems,
which Mr. Lewes wishes me to get published in
May.</p>

<p>Such of them as have been already printed in a
fugitive form have been received with many signs of
sympathy, and every one of those I now send you represents
an idea which I care for strongly, and wish to
propagate as far as I can. Else I should forbid myself
from adding to the mountainous heap of poetical
collections.</p>

<p>The form of volume I have in my eye is a delightful
duodecimo edition of Keats's poems (without the
"Endymion") published during his life: just the volume
to slip in the pocket. Mine will be the least bit
thicker.</p>

<p>I should like a darkish green cover, with Roman lettering.
But you will consider the physique and price
of the book, and kindly let me know your thoughts.</p>

<p>I fear the fatal fact about your
story<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
is the absence
of God and hell. "My dear madam, you have not
presented motives to the children!" It is really hideous
to find that those who sit in the scribes' seats
have got no further than the appeal to selfishness,
which they call God. The old Talmudists were better
teachers. They make Rachel remonstrate with
God for his hardness, and remind him that she was
kinder to her sister Leah than he to his people&mdash;thus
correcting the traditional God by human sympathy.
However, we must put up with our contemporaries,
since we can neither live with our ancestors nor with
posterity.</p>

<p>It is cheering to see the programme of your new society.
There certainly is an awakening of conscience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
about animals in general as our fellow-creatures&mdash;even
the vogue of Balaam's ass is in that sense a good sign.
A lady wrote to me the other day that when she went
to church in the island of Sark the sermon turned on
that remonstrant hero or heroine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I can imagine how great an encouragement you feel
from the enthusiasm generously expressed in Mr. C.'s
letter. It is always an admirable impulse to express
deeply felt admiration, but it is also possible that
you have some grateful readers who do not write to
you. I have heard men whose greatest delight is literature,
say that they should never dream of writing to
an author on the ground of his books alone.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Francis Newman must be aged now and
rather weary of the world and explanations of the
world. He can hardly be expected to take in much
novelty. I have a sort of affectionate sadness in thinking
of the interest which, in far-off days, I felt in his
"Soul" and "Phases of Faith," and of the awe I had
of him as a lecturer on mathematics at the Ladies'
College. How much work he has done in the world
which has left no deep, conspicuous mark, but has
probably entered beneficially into many lives!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>How glorious this opening spring is! At this moment
even London is so beautiful that I come home
filled with the Park landscapes, and see them as a
background to all my thoughts. Your account of Mr.
George Dawson is rather melancholy. I remember
him only as a bright, vigorous, young man&mdash;such as
perhaps his sons are now. I imagine it is his fortune,
or, rather, misfortune, to have talked too much and too
early about the greatest things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I could not dwell on your sweet

yesterday&mdash;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
should perhaps have begun to cry, which would not
have been <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">convenable</i> in a hostess. For I have been
in a suffering, depressed condition lately, so your good,
loving deed has come just at the right time&mdash;when I
need the helpfulness that love brings me&mdash;and my heart
turns to you with grateful blessing this Monday morning.</p>

<p>I have been looking at the little paintings with a
treble delight, because they were done for <em>me</em>, because
you chose for them subjects of my "making," and because
they are done with a promising charm of execution
(which Mr. Lewes feels as well as I). It gives
me special gladness that you have this sort of work
before you. Some skill or other with the hands is
needful for the completeness of the life, and makes a
bridge over times of doubt and despondency.</p>

<p>Perhaps it will please you to know that nineteen
years ago, when Mr. Lewes and I were looking at a
print of Goethe's statue by Ritzchl, which stands on a
pedestal ornamented with <i>bassi relievi</i> of his characters,
I said (little believing that my wish would ever be fulfilled),
"How I should like to be surrounded with
creatures of my own making!" And yesterday, when
I was looking at your gift, that little incident recurred
to me. Your love seemed to have made me a miniature
pedestal.</p>

<p>I was comforted yesterday that you and J. had at
least the pleasure of hearing Bice Trollope sing, to
make some amends for the long, cold journey. Please
do not any of you, forget that we shall only be three
weeks more in this corner of the world, and that we
want to see you as often as you care to come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Journal,
1874.</div>

<p><i>May 19.</i>&mdash;This month has been published a volume
of my poems&mdash;"Legend of Jubal, and other Poems."
On the 1st of June we go into the country to the cottage,
Earlswood Common, for four months, and I hope
there to get deep shafts sunk in my prose book. My
health has been a wretched drag on me during this
last half-year. I have lately written "a symposium."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Cross,
14th June,
1874.</div>

<p>I have so much trust in your love for us that I feel
sure you will like to know of our happiness in the secure
peace of the country, and the good we already
experience in soul and body from the sweet breezes
over hill and common, the delicious silence, and the
unbroken spaces of the day. Just now the chill east
wind has brought a little check to our pleasure in our
long afternoon drives; and I could wish that Canon
Kingsley and his fellow-worshippers of that harsh divinity
could have it reserved entirely for themselves as
a tribal god.</p>

<p>We think the neighborhood so lovely that I must
beg you to tell J. we are in danger of settling here unless
he makes haste to find us a house in your "country-side"&mdash;a
house with undeniable charms, on high
ground, in a strictly rural neighborhood (water and
gas laid on, nevertheless), to be vacant precisely this
autumn!</p>

<p>My philosopher is writing away with double <i>verve</i> in
a projecting window, where he can see a beautiful
green slope crowned and studded with large trees. I,
too, have an agreeable corner in another room. Our
house has the essentials of comfort, and we have reason
to be contented with it.</p>

<p>I confess that my chief motive for writing about ourselves
is to earn some news of you, which will not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
denied me by one or other of the dear pairs of hands
always ready to do us a kindness.</p>

<p>Our Sunday is really a Sabbath now&mdash;a day of thorough
peace. But I shall get hungry for a sight of
some of the Sunday visitors before the end of September.</p>

<p>I include all your family in a spiritual embrace, and
am always yours lovingly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John
Blackwood,
16th
June, 1874.</div>

<p>We are revelling in the peace of the country, and
have no drawback to our delight except the cold winds,
which have forced us to put on winter clothing for the
last four or five days.</p>

<p>Our wide common is very breezy, and the wind
makes mournful music round our walls. But I should
think it is not possible to find a much healthier region
than this round Reigate and Redhill; and it is prettier
than half the places one crosses the Channel to see.
We have been hunting about for a permanent country
home in the neighborhood, but no house is so difficult
to get as one which has at once seclusion and convenience
of position, which is neither of the suburban-villa
style nor of the grand hall and castle dimensions.</p>

<p>The restoration of the empire (in France), which is
a threatening possibility, seems to me a degrading
issue. In the restoration of the monarchy I should
have found something to rejoice at, but the traditions
of the empire, both first and second, seem to my sentiment
bad. Some form of military despotism must
be, as you say, the only solution where no one political
party knows how to behave itself. The American pattern
is certainly being accepted as to senatorial manners.
I dare say you have been to Knebworth and
talked over French matters with Lord Lytton. We
are grieved to hear from him but a poor account of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
sweet Lady Lytton's health and spirits. She is to me
one of the most charming types of womanliness, and I
long for her to have all a woman's best blessings.</p>

<p>The good news about the small remainder of "Jubal"
is very welcome, and I will write at once to Mr.
Simpson to send him my two or three corrections, and
my wishes about the new edition. The price of the
book will well bear a thicker and a handsomely tinted
paper, especially now it has proved movable; and I
felt so much the difference to the eye and touch of the
copies on rich tinted paper, that I was much vexed
with myself for having contributed to the shabby appearance
of the current edition by suggesting the thin
Keats volume as a model. People have become used
to more luxurious editions; and I confess to the weakness
of being affected by paper and type in something
of the same subtile way I am affected by the odor of a
room.</p>

<p>Many thanks for Lord Neaves's pleasant little book,
which is a capital example of your happily planned
publication.</p>

<p>I came down here half poisoned by the French theatre,
but I am flourishing now, and am brewing my
future big book with more or less (generally less) belief
in the quality of the liquor which will be drawn off.
The secured peacefulness and the pure air of the country
make our time of double worth; and we mean to
give no invitations to London friends desirous of
change. We are selfishly bent on dual solitude.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Peter
Taylor, 1st
July, 1874.</div>

<p>I am so glad to know from your kind letter that you
are interesting yourself, with Madame Belloc, in the
poor workhouse girls. You see my only social work
is to rejoice in the labors of others, while I live in luxurious
remoteness from all turmoil. Of course you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
have seen Mrs. Senior's report. I read it, and thought
it very wise, very valuable in many ways, and since
then she has sent me word how much she has been
worried about it by (as I imagine) obstructive officials.</p>

<p>We are revelling in our country peacefulness, in
spite of the chills and rain, driving about every day
that the weather will allow, and finding in each drive
new beauties of this loveliest part of a lovely country.
We are looking out for a house in this neighborhood
as a permanent retreat; not with the idea of giving
up our London house, at least for some years, but simply
of having a place to which we may come for about
six months of the year, and perhaps finally shrink into
altogether.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Wm.
Smith, 1st
July, 1874.</div>

<p>Only the day before your letter came to me I had
been saying, "I wonder how our dear Mrs. William
Smith is?" so that your impulse to write to me satisfied
a need of mine. I cannot help rejoicing that you
are in the midst of lovely scenery again, for I had had
a presentiment that Cambridge was antipathetic to
you; and, indeed, I could not have imagined that you
would be in the right place there but for the promised
helpfulness of your presence to a young friend.</p>

<p>You tell me much that is interesting. Your picture
of Mr. and Mrs. Stirling, and what you say of the reasons
why one may wish even for the anguish of being
<em>left</em> for the sake of waiting on the beloved one to the
end&mdash;all that goes to my heart of hearts. It is what
I think of almost daily. For death seems to me now
a close, real experience, like the approach of autumn
or winter, and I am glad to find that advancing life
brings this power of imagining the nearness of death I
never had till of late years. I remember all you told
me of your niece's expected marriage, and your joy in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the husband who has chosen her. It is wealth you
have&mdash;that of several sweet nieces to whom being with
you is a happiness. You can feel some sympathy in
their cheerfulness, even though sorrow is always your
only private good&mdash;can you not, dear friend?&mdash;and
the time is short at the utmost. The blessed reunion,
if it may come, must be patiently waited for; and
such good as you can do others, by loving looks and
words, must seem to you like a closer companionship
with the gentleness and benignity which you justly
worshipped while it was visibly present, and still more,
perhaps, now it is veiled, and is a memory stronger
than vision of outward things. We are revelling in
the sweet peace of the country, and shall remain here
till the end of September.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes sends his affectionate remembrances with
mine. I am scribbling while he holds my bed-candle,
so pray forgive any incoherency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I have two questions to ask of your benevolence.
First, was there not some village near Stonehenge
where you stayed the night, nearer to Stonehenge than
Amesbury? Secondly, do you know anything specific
about Holmwood <i>Common</i> as a place of residence? It
is ravishingly beautiful; is it in its higher part thoroughly
unobjectionable as a site for a dwelling?</p>

<p>It seems that they have been having the heat of
Tophet in London, whereas we have never had more
than agreeable sunniness, this common being almost
always breezy. And the country around us must, I
think, be the loveliest of its undulating, woody kind in
all England.</p>

<p>I remember, when we were driving together last,
something was said about my disposition to melancholy.
I ought to have said then, but did not, that I am no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
longer one of those whom Dante found in hell border
because they had been sad under the blessed
sunlight.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
I am uniformly cheerful now&mdash;feeling the preciousness
of these moments, in which I still possess
love and thought.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to Mrs.
Burne-Jones,
3d
Aug. 1874.</div>

<p>It was sweet of you to write me that nice long letter.
I was athirst for some news of you. Life, as you
say, is a big thing. No wonder there comes a season
when we cease to look round and say, "How shall I
enjoy?" but, as in a country which has been visited by
the sword, pestilence, and famine, think only how we
shall help the wounded, and how find seed for the
next harvest&mdash;how till the earth and make a little time
of gladness for those who are being born without their
own asking. I am so glad of what you say about the
Latin. Go on conquering and to conquer a little kingdom
for yourself there.</p>

<p>We are, as usual, getting more than our share of
peace and other good, except in the matter of warmth
and sunshine. Our common is a sort of ball-room for
the winds, and on the warmest days we have had here
we have found them at their music and dancing. They
roar round the corners of our house in a wintry fashion,
while the sun is shining on the brown grass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John
Blackwood,
8th
Aug. 1874.</div>

<p>Thanks for sending me the good news. The sale
of "Middlemarch" is wonderful "out of all whooping,"
and, considered as manifesting the impression made
by the book, is more valuable than any amount of immediate
distribution. I suppose there will be a new
edition of the "Spanish Gypsy" wanted by Christmas;
and I have a carefully corrected copy by me, containing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
my final alterations, to which I desire to have the
stereotyped plates adjusted.</p>

<p>As to confidence in the work to be done I am somewhat
in the condition suggested to Armgart, "How
will you bear the poise of eminence with dread of falling?"
And the other day, having a bad headache, I
did what I have sometimes done before at intervals of
five or six years&mdash;looked into three or four novels to
see what the world was reading. The effect was paralyzing,
and certainly justifies me in that abstinence
from novel-reading which, I fear, makes me seem supercilious
or churlish to the many persons who send
me their books, or ask me about their friends' books.
To be delivered from all doubts as to one's justification
in writing at this stage of the world, one should
have either a plentiful faith in one's own exceptionalness,
or a plentiful lack of money. Tennyson said to
me, "Everybody writes so well now;" and if the lace
is only machine-made, it still pushes out the hand-made,
which has differences only for a fine, fastidious
appreciation. To write indifferently after having written
well&mdash;that is, from a true, individual store which
makes a special contribution&mdash;is like an eminent clergyman
spoiling his reputation by lapses, and neutralizing
all the good he did before. However, this is
superfluous stuff to write to you. It is only a sample
of the way in which depression works upon me. I am
not the less grateful for all the encouragement I get.</p>

<p>I saw handsome Dean Liddell at Oxford. He is
really a grand figure. They accuse him of being obstructive
to much-needed reforms. For my own part
I am thankful to him for his share in "Liddell and
Scott" and his capital little Roman History. <i>À propos</i>
of books and St. Andrews, I have read aloud to Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Lewes Professor Flint's volume, and we have both been
much pleased with its conscientious presentation and
thorough effort at fairness.</p>

<p>We have enjoyed the country, as we always do; but
we have been, for our constitutions, a little unfortunate
in the choice of a spot which is the windiest of the
windy. That heat which we have read and heard of
has hardly been at all felt by us; and we have both
suffered a little from chills. You will perceive from
my letter I am just now possessed by an evil spirit in
the form of headache; but on the whole I am much
the stronger for the peace and the delicious air, which
I take in as a conscious addition to the good of living.</p>

<p>We have been near buying a little country hermitage
on Holmwood Common&mdash;a grand spot, with a view
hard to match in our flat land. But we have been
frightened away by its windiness. I rather envy Major
Lockhart and the rest of the golfian enthusiasts; to
have a seductive idleness which is really a healthy
activity is invaluable to people who have desk-work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs H. B.
Stowe, 11th
Nov. 1874.</div>

<p>I feel rather disgraced by the fact that I received
your last kind letter nearly two months ago. But a
brief note of mine, written immediately on hearing of
you from Mrs. Fields, must have crossed yours and the
Professor's kind letters to me; and I hope it proved
to you that I love you in my heart.</p>

<p>We were in the country then, but soon afterwards
we set out on a six-weeks' journey, and we are but just
settled in our winter home.</p>

<p>Those unspeakable troubles in which I necessarily
felt more for <em>you</em> than for any one else concerned, are,
I trust, well at an end, and you are enjoying a time of
peace. It was like your own sympathetic energy to be
able, even while the storm was yet hanging in your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
sky, to write to me about my husband's books. Will
you not agree with me that there is one comprehensive
Church whose fellowship consists in the desire to purify
and ennoble human life, and where the best members
of all narrower Churches may call themselves
brother and sister in spite of differences? I am writing
to your dear husband as well as to you, and in answer
to his question about Goethe, I must say, for my
part, that I think he had a strain of mysticism in his
soul&mdash;of so much mysticism as I think inevitably belongs
to a full, poetic nature&mdash;I mean the delighted
bathing of the soul in emotions which overpass the outlines
of definite thought. I should take the "Imitation"
as a type (it is one which your husband also
mentions), but perhaps I might differ from him in my
attempt to interpret the unchangeable and universal
meanings of that great book.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes, however, who has a better right than I to
a conclusion about Goethe, thinks that he entered into
the experience of the mystic&mdash;as in the confessions of
the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schöne Seele</i>&mdash;simply by force of his sympathetic
genius, and that his personal individual bent was towards
the clear and plastic exclusively. Do not imagine
that Mr. Lewes is guided in his exposition by theoretic
antipathies. He is singularly tolerant of difference,
and able to admire what is unlike himself.</p>

<p>He is busy now correcting the proofs of his second
volume. I wonder whether you have headaches and
are rickety as we are, or whether you have a glorious

ninety.</p>

<p>We have spent this year in much happiness, and are
sorry to part with it. From the beginning of June to
the end of September we had a house in Surrey, and
enjoyed delicious quiet with daily walks and drives in
the lovely scenery round Reigate and Dorking. October
we spent in a country visit to friends (Six-Mile
Bottom) and in a journey to Paris, and through the
Ardennes homeward, finishing off our travels by some
excursions in our own country, which we are ready to
say we will never quit again&mdash;it is so much better
worth knowing than most places one travels abroad to
see. We make ourselves amends for being in London
by going to museums to see the wonderful works of
men; and the other day I was taken over the Bank of
England and to Woolwich Arsenal&mdash;getting object-lessons
in my old age, you perceive. Mr. Lewes is
half through the proof-correcting of his second volume;
and it will be matter of rejoicing when the other half
is done, for we both hate proof-correcting (do you?)&mdash;the
writing always seems worse than it really is when
one reads it in patches, looking out for mistakes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
the Hon.
Mrs. Ponsonby
(now
Lady Ponsonby),
10th Dec.

<p>My books have for their main bearing a conclusion
the opposite of that in which your studies seem to have
painfully imprisoned you&mdash;a conclusion without which
I could not have cared to write any representation of
human life&mdash;namely, that the fellowship between man
and man which has been the principle of development,
social and moral, is not dependent on conceptions of
what is not man: and that the idea of God, so far as
it has been a high spiritual influence, is the ideal of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
goodness entirely human (<i>i.e.</i>, an exaltation of the
human).</p>

<p>Have you quite fairly represented yourself in saying
that you have ceased to pity your suffering fellow-men,
because you can no longer think of them as individualities
of immortal duration, in some other state of
existence than this of which you know the pains and
the pleasures?&mdash;that you feel less for them now you
regard them as more miserable? And, on a closer examination
of your feelings, should you find that you
had lost all sense of quality in actions, all possibility
of admiration that yearns to imitate, all keen sense
of what is cruel and injurious, all belief that your conduct
(and therefore the conduct of others) can have
any difference of effect on the well-being of those immediately
about you (and therefore on those afar off),
whether you carelessly follow your selfish moods, or
encourage that vision of others' needs which is the
source of justice, tenderness, sympathy in the fullest
sense&mdash;I cannot believe that your strong intellect will
continue to see, in the conditions of man's appearance
on this planet, a destructive relation to your sympathy.
This seems to me equivalent to saying that you care no
longer for color, now you know the laws of the spectrum.</p>

<p>As to the necessary combinations through which life
is manifested, and which seem to present themselves
to you as a hideous fatalism, which ought logically to
petrify your volition, have they, <em>in fact</em>, any such influence
on your ordinary course of action in the primary
affairs of your existence as a human, social, domestic
creature? And if they don't hinder you from taking
measures for a bath, without which you know that you
cannot secure the delicate cleanliness which is your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
second nature, why should they hinder you from a line
of resolve in a higher strain of duty to your ideal, both
for yourself and others? But the consideration of
molecular physics is not the direct ground of human
love and moral action any more than it is the direct
means of composing a noble picture or of enjoying
great music. One might as well hope to dissect one's
own body and be merry in doing it, as take molecular
physics (in which you must banish from your field of
view what is specifically human) to be your dominant
guide, your determiner of motives, in what is solely
human. That every study has its bearing on every
other is true; but pain and relief, love and sorrow,
have their peculiar history, which make an experience
and knowledge over and above the swing of atoms.</p>

<p>The teaching you quote as George Sand's would, I
think, deserve to be called nonsensical if it did not deserve
to be called wicked. What sort of "culture of the
intellect" is that which, instead of widening the mind to
a fuller and fuller response to all the elements of our existence,
isolates it in a moral stupidity?&mdash;which flatters
egoism with the possibility that a complex and refined
human society can continue, wherein relations have
no sacredness beyond the inclination of changing
moods?&mdash;or figures to itself an æsthetic human life that
one may compare to that of the fabled grasshoppers
who were once men, but having heard the song of the
Muses could do nothing but sing, and starved themselves
so till they died and had a fit resurrection as
grasshoppers? "And this," says Socrates, "was the
return the Muses made them."</p>

<p>With regard to the pains and limitations of one's
personal lot, I suppose there is not a single man or
woman who has not more or less need of that stoical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
resignation which is often a hidden heroism, or who, in
considering his or her past history, is not aware that it
has been cruelly affected by the ignorant or selfish action
of some fellow-being in a more or less close relation
of life. And to my mind there can be no stronger
motive than this perception, to an energetic effort that
the lives nearest to us shall not suffer in a like manner
from <em>us</em>.</p>

<p>The progress of the world&mdash;which you say can only
come at the right time&mdash;can certainly never come at
all save by the modified action of the individual beings
who compose the world; and that we can say to ourselves
with effect, "There is an order of considerations
which I will keep myself continually in mind of, so
that they may continually be the prompters of certain
feelings and actions," seems to me as undeniable as
that we can resolve to study the Semitic languages
and apply to an Oriental scholar to give us daily lessons.
What would your keen wit say to a young man
who alleged the physical basis of nervous action as a
reason why he could not possibly take that course?</p>

<p>As to duration and the way in which it affects your
view of the human history, what is really the difference
to your imagination between infinitude and billions
when you have to consider the value of human
experience? Will you say that, since your life has a
term of threescore years and ten, it was really a matter
of indifference whether you were a cripple with a
wretched skin disease, or an active creature with a
mind at large for the enjoyment of knowledge, and
with a nature which has attracted others to you?</p>

<p>Difficulties of thought&mdash;acceptance of what is, without
full comprehension&mdash;belong to every system of
thinking. The question is to find the least incomplete.

<p>When I wrote the first page of this letter I thought
I was going to say that I had not courage to enter on
the momentous points you had touched on in the
hasty, brief form of a letter. But I have been led on
sentence after sentence&mdash;not, I fear, with any inspiration
beyond that of my anxiety. You will at least pardon
any ill-advised things I may have written on the
prompting of the moment.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 13.</i>&mdash;Here is a great gap since I last made a

A second edition of "Jubal" was published in August;
and the fourth edition of the "Spanish Gypsy"
is all sold. This morning I received a copy of the
fifth edition. The amount of copies sold of "Middlemarch"
up to 31st December is between nineteen and
twenty thousand.</p>

<p>Yesterday I also received the good news that the engagement
between Emily Cross and Mr. Otter is settled.</p>

<p>The last year has been crowded with proofs of affection
for me and of value for what work I have been
able to do. This makes the best motive or encouragement
to do more; but, as usual, I am suffering much
from doubt as to the worth of what I am doing, and
fear lest I may not be able to complete it so as to
make it a contribution to literature and not a mere
addition to the heap of books. I am now just beginning

<p>Your letter was a deeply felt pleasure to me last
night; and I have one from Emily this morning, which
makes my joy in the prospect of your union as thorough
as it could well be. I could not wish either her
words or yours to be in the least different. Long ago,
when I had no notion that the event was probable, my
too hasty imagination had prefigured it and longed for

it. To say this is to say something of the high regard
with which all I have known of you has impressed
me&mdash;for I hold our sweet Emily worthy of one who
may be reckoned among the best. The possibility of
a constantly growing blessedness in marriage is to me
the very basis of good in our mortal life; and the believing
hope that you and she will experience that
blessedness seems to enrich me for the coming years.
I shall count it among my strengthening thoughts that
you both think of me with affection, and care for my
sympathy. Mr. Lewes shares in all the feelings I express,
and we are rejoicing together.</p>

<p>Writing notes is the <em>crux</em> of my life. It often interferes

is the only time I have for quiet work. For certain

<p>I should urge you to consider your early religious
experience as a portion of valid knowledge, and to
cherish its emotional results in relation to objects and
ideas which are either substitutes or metamorphoses
of the earlier. And I think we must not take every
great physicist&mdash;or other "ist"&mdash;for an apostle, but be
ready to suspect him of some crudity concerning relations
that lie outside his special studies, if his exposition
strands us on results that seem to stultify the
most ardent, massive experience of mankind, and hem
up the best part of our feelings in stagnation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
John
Blackwood,
7th
Feb. 1875.</div>

<p>Last night I finished reading aloud to Mr. Lewes
the "Inkerman" volume, and we both thank you
heartily for the valuable present. It is an admirable
piece of writing; such pure, lucid English is what one
rarely gets to read. The masterly marshalling of the
material is certainly in contrast with the movements
described. To my non-military mind the Inkerman
affair seems nothing but a brave blundering into victory.
Great traits of valor&mdash;Homeric movements&mdash;but
also a powerful lack of brains in the form of generalship.
I cannot see that the ordering up of the
two 18-pounder guns was a vast mental effort, unless
the weight of the guns is to be counted in the order as
well as in the execution. But the grand fact of the
thousands beaten by the hundreds remains under all
interpretation. Why the Russians, in their multitudinous
mass, should have chosen to retreat into Sebastopol,
moving at their leisure, and carrying off all their
artillery, seems a mystery in spite of General Dannenberg's
memorable answer to Mentschikoff.</p>

<p>There are some splendid movements in the story&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
tradition of the "Minden Yell," the "Men, remember
Albuera," and the officer of the 77th advancing
with, "Then I will go myself," with what followed, are
favorite bits of mine. My mind is in the anomalous
condition of hating war and loving its discipline, which
has been an incalculable contribution to the sentiment
of duty.</p>

<p>I have not troubled myself to read any reviews of
the book. My eye caught one in which the author's
style was accused of affectation. But I have long
learned to apply to reviewers an aphorism which tickled
me in my childhood&mdash;"There must be some such
to be some of all sorts." Pray tell Mr. Simpson that
I was much pleased with the new dress of the "Spanish
Gypsy."</p>

<p>The first part of "Giannetto" raised my interest, but
I was disappointed in the unravelling of the plot. It
seems to me neither really nor ideally satisfactory.
But it is a long while since I read a story newer than
"Rasselas," which I re-read two years ago, with a desire
to renew my childish delight in it, when it was one
of my best-loved companions. So I am a bad judge
of comparative merits among popular writers. I am
obliged to fast from fiction, and fasting is known sometimes
to weaken the stomach. I ought to except Miss
Thackeray's stories&mdash;which I cannot resist when they
come near me&mdash;and bits of Mr. Trollope, for affection's
sake. You would not wonder at my fasting, if you
knew how deplorably uncalled-for and "everything-that-it-should-not-be"
my own fiction seems to me in
times of inward and outward fog&mdash;like this morning,
when the light is dim on my paper.</p>

to know how ideas lie in other minds than my own,
that I may not miss their difficulties while I am urging
only what satisfies myself. I shall be deeply interested
in knowing exactly what you wrote at that particular
stage. Please remember that I don't consider
myself a teacher, but a companion in the struggle of
thought. What can consulting physicians do without
pathological knowledge? and the more they have of
it, the less absolute&mdash;the more tentative&mdash;are their
procedures.</p>

<p>You will see by the <cite>Fortnightly</cite>, which you have not
read, that Mr. Spencer is very anxious to vindicate
himself from neglect of the logical necessity that the
evolution of the abstraction "society" is dependent
on the modified action of the units; indeed, he is very
sensitive on the point of being supposed to teach an
enervating fatalism.</p>

<p>Consider what the human mind <i>en masse</i> would have
been if there had been no such combination of elements
in it as has produced poets. All the philosophers
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savants</i> would not have sufficed to supply
that deficiency. And how can the life of nations be

<p>We cannot believe that there is reason to fear any
painful observations on the publication of the memoir
in one volume with "Gravenhurst" and the essays.
The memoir is written with exquisite judgment and
feeling; and without estimating too highly the taste
and carefulness of journalists in their ordinary treatment
of books, I think that we may count on their not
being impressed otherwise than respectfully and sympathetically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
with the character of your dear husband's
work, and with the sketch of his pure, elevated life. I
would also urge you to rely on the fact that Mr. Blackwood
thinks the publication desirable, as a guarantee
that it will not prove injudicious in relation to the
outer world&mdash;I mean, the world beyond the circle of
your husband's especial friends and admirers. I am
grieved to hear of your poor eyes having been condemned
to an inaction which, I fear, may have sadly
increased the vividness of that inward seeing, already
painfully strong in you. There has been, I trust, always
some sympathetic young companionship to help
you&mdash;some sweet voice to read aloud to you, or to talk
of those better things in human lots which enable us
to look at the good of life a little apart from our own
particular sorrow.</p>

<p>We admire our bit of Hertfordshire greatly; but I
should be glad of more breezy common land and far-reaching
outlooks. For fertility, wealth of grand trees,
parks, mansions, and charming bits of stream and canal,
our neighborhood can hardly be excelled. And our
house is a good old red-brick Georgian place, with a
nice bit of garden and meadow and river at the back.
Perhaps we are too much in the valley, and have too
large a share of mist, which often lies white on our
meadows in the early evening. But who has not had
too much moisture in this calamitously wet, cold summer?</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes is very busy, but not in zoologizing. We
reserve that for October, when we mean to go to the
coast for a few weeks. It is a long while since I
walked on broad sands and watched the receding tide;
and I look forward agreeably to a renewal of that old
pleasure.</p>

<p>I am not particularly flourishing in this pretty region,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
probably owing to the low barometer. The air
has been continually muggy, and has lain on one's

The sense of your nearness had been so long
missing to us that we had begun to take up with life as
inevitably a little less cheerful than we remembered it
to have been formerly, without thinking of restoration.</p>

<p>My box is quite dear to me, and shall be used for
stamps, as you recommend, unless I find another use
that will lead me to open it and think of you the oftener.
It is very precious to me that you bore me in your
mind, and took that trouble to give me pleasure&mdash;in
which you have succeeded.</p>

<p>Our house here is rather a fine old brick Georgian
place, with a lovely bit of landscape; but I think we
have suffered the more from the rainy, close weather, because
we are in a valley, and can see the mists lie in a
thick, white stratum on our meadows. Mr. Lewes has
been, on the whole, flourishing and enjoying&mdash;writing
away with vigor, and making a discovery or theory at
the rate of one per diem.</p>

<p>Of me you must expect no good. I have been in a
piteous state of debility in body and depression in
mind. My book seems to me so unlikely ever to be
finished in a way that will make it worth giving to
the world, that it is a kind of glass in which I behold
my infirmities.</p>

<p>That expedition on the Thames would be a great
delight, if it were possible to us. But our arrangements
forbid it. Our loving thanks to Mr. Druce, as
well as to you, for reviving the thought. We are to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
remain here till the 23d of September; then to fly
through town, or at least only perch there for a night
or so, and then go down to the coast, while the servants
clean our house. We expect that Bournemouth
will be our destination.</p>

<p>Let us have news of you all again soon. Let us comfort
each other while it is day, for the night cometh.</p>

<p>I don't mind how many letters I receive from one
who interests me as much as you do. The receptive
part of correspondence I can carry on with much alacrity.
It is writing answers that I groan over. Please
take it as a proof of special feeling that I declined
answering your kind inquiries by proxy.</p>

<p>This corner of Hertfordshire is as pretty as it can
be of the kind. There are really rural bits at every
turn. But for my particular taste I prefer such a region
as that round Haslemere&mdash;with wide, furzy commons
and a grander horizon. Also I prefer a country where
I don't make bad blood by having to see one public
house to every six dwellings&mdash;which is literally the
case in many spots around us. My gall rises at the
rich brewers in Parliament and out of it, who plant
these poison shops for the sake of their million-making
trade, while probably their families are figuring somewhere
as refined philanthropists or devout Evangelicals
and Ritualists.</p>

<p>You perceive from this that I am dyspeptic and disposed
to melancholy views. In fact, I have not been
flourishing, but I am getting a little better; grateful
thanks that you will care to know it. On the whole
the sins of brewers, with their drugged ale and devil's

traps, depress me less than my own inefficiency. But
every fresh morning is an opportunity that one can
look forward to for exerting one's will. I shall not be
satisfied with your philosophy till you have conciliated
necessitarianism&mdash;I hate the ugly word&mdash;with the
practice of willing strongly, willing to will strongly,
and so on, that being what you certainly can do and
have done about a great many things in life, whence it
is clear that there is nothing in truth to hinder you
from it&mdash;except, you will say, the absence of a motive.
But that absence I don't believe in in your case&mdash;only
in the case of empty, barren souls.</p>

<p>Are you not making a transient confusion of intuitions

though otherwise peaceful, was not marked by any
great improvement in health from the change to country
instead of town&mdash;rather the contrary. We left on
23d September, and then set off on a journey into
Wales, which was altogether unfortunate on account
of the excessive rain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John
Blackwood,
10th
Oct. 1875.</div>

<p>I behaved rather shabbily in not thanking you otherwise
than by proxy for the kind letter you sent me to
Rickmansworth, but I had a bad time down there, and
did less of everything than I desired. Last night we
returned from our trip&mdash;a very lively word for a journey
made in the worst weather; and since I am, on the
whole, the better for a succession of small discomforts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
in hotels, and struggling walks taken under
an umbrella, I have no excuse for not writing a line to
my neglected correspondents.</p>

<p>You will laugh at our nervous caution in depositing
our MSS. at the Union Bank before we set out. We
could have borne to hear that our house had been
burned down, provided no lives were lost, and our unprinted
matter, our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&oelig;uvres inédites</i>, were safe out of it.</p>

<p>About <em>my</em> unprinted matter, Mr. Lewes thinks it will
not be well to publish the first part till February. The
four first monthly parts are ready for travelling now.
It will be well to begin the printing in good time, so
that I may not be hurried with the proofs; and I must
beg Mr. Simpson to judge for me in that matter with
kind carefulness.</p>

<p>I can't say that I am at all satisfied with the book,
or that I have a comfortable sense of doing in it what
I want to do; but Mr. Lewes <em>is</em> satisfied with it, and
insists that since he is as anxious as possible for it to
be fine, I ought to accept his impressions as trustworthy.
So I resign myself.</p>

<p>I read aloud the "Abode of Snow" at Rickmansworth,
to our mutual delight; and we are both very
much obliged to you for the handsome present. But
what an amazing creature is this Andrew Wilson to
have kept pluck for such travelling while his body was
miserably ailing! One would have said that he had
more than the average spirit of hardy men to have persevered
even in good health after a little taste of the
difficulties he describes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Peter
Taylor,
20th Oct.
1875.</div>

<p>The arrangements as to the publication of my next
book are already determined on. Ever since "Adam
Bede" appeared I have been continually having proposals
from the proprietors or editors of periodicals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
but I have always declined them, except in the case
of "Romola," which appeared in the <cite>Cornhill</cite>, and was
allowed to take up a varying and unusual number of
pages. I have the strongest objection to cutting up
my work into little bits; and there is no motive to it
on my part, since I have a large enough public already.
But, even apart from that objection, it would not now be
worth the while of any magazine or journal to give me
a sum such as my books yield in separate publication.
I had £7000 for "Romola," but the mode in which
"Middlemarch" was issued brings in a still larger
sum. I ought to say, however, that the question is not
entirely one of money with me: if I could gain <em>more</em>
by splitting my writing into small parts, I would not
do it, because the effect would be injurious as a matter
of art. So much detail I trouble you with to save
misapprehension.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John
Blackwood,
18th
Nov. 1875.</div>

<p>Your enjoyment of the proofs cheers me greatly; and
pray thank Mrs. Blackwood for her valuable hints on
equine matters. I have not only the satisfaction of
using those hints, I allow myself the inference that
where there is no criticism on like points I have made
no mistake.</p>

<p>I should be much obliged to Mr. Simpson&mdash;whom I
am glad that Gwendolen has captivated&mdash;if he would
rate the printers a little about their want of spacing.
I am anxious that my poor heroes and heroines should
have all the advantage that paper and print can give
them.</p>

<p>It will perhaps be a little comfort to you to know
that poor Gwen is spiritually saved, but "so as by
fire." Don't you see the process already beginning?
I have no doubt you do, for you are a wide-awake
reader.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>But what a climate to expect good writing in! Skating
in the morning and splashy roads in the afternoon
is just typical of the alternation from frigid to flaccid
in the author's bodily system, likely to give a corresponding
variety to the style.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara
Hennell,
20th Nov.
1875.</div>

<p>I got my head from under the pressure of other
matters, like a frog from under the water, to send you
my November greeting. My silence through the rest
of the months makes you esteem me the more, I hope,
seeing that you yourself hate letter-writing&mdash;a remarkable
exception to the rule that people like doing what
they can do well, if one can call that a rule of which
the reverse seems more frequent&mdash;namely, that they like
doing what they do ill.</p>

<p>We stayed till nearly the end of September at the
house we had taken in Hertfordshire. After that we
went into Wales for a fortnight, and were under umbrellas
nearly the whole time.</p>

<p>I wonder if you all remember an old governess of
mine who used to visit me at Foleshill&mdash;a Miss Lewis?
I have found her out. She is living at Leamington,
very poor as well as old, but cheerful, and so delighted
to be remembered with gratitude. How very old we
are all getting! But I hope you don't mind it any
more than I do. One sees so many contemporaries
that one is well in the fashion. The approach of parting
is the bitterness of age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John
Blackwood,
15th
Dec. 1875.</div>

<p>Your letter is an agreeable tonic, very much needed,
for that wretched hinderance of a cold last week has
trailed after it a series of headaches worse than itself.
An additional impression, like Mr. Langford's, of the
two volumes is really valuable, as a sign that I have
not so far failed in relation to a variety of readers.
But you know that in one sense I count nothing done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
as long as anything remains to do; and it always seems
to me that the worst difficulty is still to come. In the
sanest, soberest judgment, however, I think the third
volume (which I have not yet finished) would be regarded
as the difficult bridge. I will not send you any
more MS. until I can send the whole of vol. iii.</p>

<p>We think that Mr. Simpson has conducted our Australian
business admirably. Remembering that but
for his judgment and consequent activity we might
have got no publication at all in that quarter, we may
well be content with £200.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes has not got the Life of Heine, and will be
much pleased and obliged by your gift.</p>

<p>Major Lockhart's lively letter gives one a longing
for the fresh, breezy life and fine scenery it conjures
up. You must let me know when there is a book of
his, because when I have done my own I shall like to
read something else by him. I got much pleasure out
of the two books I did read. But when I am writing,
or only thinking of writing, fiction of my own, I cannot
risk the reading of other English fiction. I was
obliged to tell Anthony Trollope so when he sent me
the first part of his "Prime Minister," though this
must seem sadly ungracious to those who don't share
my susceptibilities.</p>

<p>Apparently there are wild reports about the subject-matter
of "Deronda"&mdash;among the rest, that it represents
French life! But that is hardly more ridiculous
than the supposition that after refusing to go to America,
I should undertake to describe society there! It
is wonderful how "Middlemarch" keeps afloat in people's
minds. Somebody told me that Mr. Henry Sidgwick
said it was a bold thing to write another book
after "Middlemarch," and we must prepare ourselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
for the incalculableness of the public reception in the
first instance. I think I have heard you say that the
chief result of your ample experience has been to convince
you of that incalculableness.</p>

<p>What a blow for Miss Thackeray&mdash;the death of that
sister to whom she was so closely bound in affection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Journal,
1875.</div>

<p><i>Dec. 25.</i>&mdash;After our return from Wales in October I
grew better and wrote with some success. For the
last three weeks, however, I have been suffering from
a cold and its effects so as to be unable to make any
progress. Meanwhile the two first volumes of "Daniel
Deronda" are in print, and the first book is to be published
on February 1st. I have thought very poorly
of it myself throughout, but George and the Blackwoods
are full of satisfaction in it. Each part as I see
it before me <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">im werden</i> seems less likely to be anything
else than a failure; but I see on looking back
this morning&mdash;Christmas Day&mdash;that I really was in
worse health and suffered equal depression about
"Romola;" and, so far as I have recorded, the same
thing seems to be true of "Middlemarch."</p>

<p>I have finished the fifth book, but am not far on in
the sixth, as I hoped to have been; the oppression under
which I have been laboring having positively suspended
my power of writing anything that I could feel
satisfaction in.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Letter to
John
Blackwood,
17th
March,
1876.</div>

<p>We have just come in from Weybridge, but are going
to take refuge there again on Monday for a few
days more of fresh air and long, breezy afternoon
walks. Many thanks for your thoughtfulness in sending
me the cheering account of sales.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes has not heard any complaints of not understanding
Gwendolen, but a strong partisanship for
and against her. My correspondence about the misquotation
of Tennyson has quieted itself since the
fifth letter. But one gentleman has written me a very
pretty note, taxing me with having wanted insight into
the technicalities of Newmarket, when I made Lush
say, "I will <em>take</em> odds." He judges that I should
have written, "I will lay odds." On the other hand,
another expert contends that the case is one in which
Lush would be more likely to say, "I will take odds."
What do you think? I told my correspondent that I
had a dread of being righteously pelted with mistakes
that would make a cairn above me&mdash;a monument and
a warning to people who write novels without being
omniscient and infallible.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes is agitating himself over a fifth reading
of revise, Book VI., and says he finds it more interesting
than on any former reading. It is agreeable to
have a home criticism of this kind! But I am deep
in the fourth volume, and cannot any longer care
about what is past and done for&mdash;the passion of the
moment is as much as I can live in.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>We had beautiful skies with our cold, and only now
and then a snow shower. It is grievous to read of
the suffering elsewhere from floods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Madame
Bodichon,
30th
March,
1876.</div>

<p>I am well pleased that "Deronda" touches you. I
<em>wanted</em> you to prefer the chapter about Mirah's finding,
and I hope you will also like her history in Part
III., which has just been published.</p>

<p>We want very much to get away, but I fear we shall
hardly be able to start till the end of May. At present
we think of the Maritime Alps as a destination
for the warm summer&mdash;if we have such a season this
year; but we shall wander a little on our way thither,
and not feel bound to accomplish anything in particular.
Meanwhile we are hearing some nice music occasionally,
and we are going to see Tennyson's play,
which is to be given on the 15th. The occasion will
be very interesting, and I should be very sorry to
miss it.</p>

<p>We have been getting a little refreshment from two
flights between Sundays to Weybridge. But we have
had the good a little drained from us by going out to
dinner two days in succession. At Sir James Paget's
I was much interested to find that a gentle-looking,
clear-eyed, neatly-made man was Sir Garnet Wolseley;
and I had some talk with him, which quite confirmed
the impression of him as one of those men who have
a power of command by dint of their sweet temper,
calm demeanor, and unswerving resolution. The next
subject that has filled our chat lately has been the
Blue Book on Vivisection, which you would like to
look into. There is a great deal of matter for reflection
in the evidence on the subject, and some good
points have been lately put in print, and conversation
that I should like to tell you of if I had time. Professor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Clifford told us the other Sunday that Huxley
complained of his sufferings from "the profligate lying
of virtuous women."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Journal,
1876.</div>

<p><i>April 12.</i>&mdash;On February 1st began the publication
of "Deronda," and the interest of the public, strong
from the first, appears to have increased with Book
III. The day before yesterday I sent off Book VII.
The success of the work at present is greater than
that of "Middlemarch" up to the corresponding point
of publication. What will be the feeling of the public
as the story advances I am entirely doubtful. The
Jewish element seems to me likely to satisfy nobody.
I am in rather better health&mdash;having, perhaps, profited
by some eight days' change at Weybridge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
John
Blackwood,
18th
April, 1876.</div>

<p>Your sympathetic letter is a welcome support to me
in the rather depressed condition which has come upon
me from the effect, I imagine, of a chill taken in the
sudden change from mildness to renewed winter. You
can understand how trying it is to have a week of
incompetence at the present stage of affairs. I am
rather concerned to see that the part is nearly a sheet
smaller than any of the other parts. But Books V.
and VI. are proportionately thick. It seemed inadmissible
to add anything after the scene with Gwendolen;
and to stick anything in not necessary to development
between the foregoing chapters is a form
of "matter in the wrong place" particularly repulsive
to my authorship's sensibility.</p>

<p>People tell us that the book is enormously discussed,
and I must share with you rather a neat coincidence
which pleased us last week. Perhaps you saw what
Mr. Lewes told me of&mdash;namely, that [a critic] opined
that the scenes between Lush and Grandcourt were
not <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vraisemblable</i>&mdash;were of the imperious feminine, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the masculine, character. Just afterwards Mr. Lewes
was chatting with a friend who, without having read
the [criticism] or having the subject in the least led
up to by Mr. Lewes, said that he had been at Lady
Waldegraves', where the subject of discussion had been
"Deronda;" and Bernal Osborne, delivering himself
on the book, said that the very best parts were the
scenes between Grandcourt and Lush. Don't you
think that Bernal Osborne has seen more of the
Grandcourt and Lush life than that critic has seen?
But several men of experience have put their fingers
on those scenes as having surprising verisimilitude;
and I naturally was peculiarly anxious about such testimony,
where my construction was founded on a less
direct knowledge.</p>

<p>We are rather vexed, now it is too late, that I did
not carry out a sort of incipient intention to expunge
a motto from Walt Whitman which I inserted in Book
IV. Of course the whole is irrevocable by this time;
but I should have otherwise thought it worth while to
have a new page, not because the motto itself is objectionable
to me&mdash;it was one of the finer things which
had clung to me from among his writings&mdash;but because,
since I quote so few poets, my selection of a
motto from Walt Whitman might be taken as a sign
of a special admiration, which I am very far from feeling.
How imperfectly one's mind acts in proof-reading!
Mr. Lewes had taken up Book IV. yesterday to
re-read it for his pleasure merely; and though he had
read it several times before, he never till yesterday
made a remark against taking a motto from Walt
Whitman. I, again, had continually had an <i>appetency</i>
towards removing the motto, and had never carried it
out&mdash;perhaps from that sort of flaccidity which comes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
over me about what <em>has been</em> done, when I am occupied
with what <em>is being</em> done.</p>

<p>People in their eagerness about my characters are
quite angry, it appears, when their own expectations
are not fulfilled&mdash;angry, for example, that Gwendolen
accepts Grandcourt, etc., etc.</p>

<p>One reader is sure that Mirah is going to die very
soon, and, I suppose, will be disgusted at her remaining
alive. Such are the reproaches to which I make
myself liable. However, that you seem to share Mr.
Lewes's strong feeling of Book VII. being no falling
off in intensity makes me brave. Only endings
are inevitably the least satisfactory part of any work
in which there is any merit of development.</p>

<p>I forgot to say that the "tephillin" are the small
leather bands or phylacteries, inscribed with supremely
sacred words, which the Jew binds on his arms and
head during prayer.</p>

<p>Any periphrasis which would be generally intelligible
would be undramatic; and I don't much like explanatory
foot-notes in a poem or story. But I must
consider what I can do to remedy the unintelligibility.</p>

<p>The printers have sadly spoiled the beautiful Greek
name Kalonymos, which was the name of a celebrated
family of scholarly Jews, transplanted from Italy into
Germany in mediæval times. But my writing was in
fault.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. H. B.
Stowe, 6th
May, 1876.</div>

<p>Your letter was one of the best cordials I could
have. Is there anything that cheers and strengthens
more than the sense of another's worth and tenderness?
And it was that sense that your letter stirred
in me, not only by the words of fellowship and encouragement
you give directly to me, but by all you
tell me of your own feeling under your late painful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
experience. I had felt it long since I had heard of
your and the Professor's well being; but I need not
say one word to you of the reasons why I am not
active towards my distant friends except in thought.
I <em>do</em> think of them, and have a tenacious memory of
every little sign they have given me. Please offer my
reverential love to the Professor, and tell him I am
ruthlessly proud that I kept him out of his bed. I
hope that both you and he will continue to be interested
in my spiritual children. My cares for them
are nearly at an end, and in a few weeks we expect to
set out on a Continental journey, as the sort of relaxation
which carries one most thoroughly away from
studies and social claims. You rightly divine that I
am a little overdone, but my fatigue is due not to any
excess of work so much as to the vicissitudes of our
long winter, which have affected me severely as they
have done all delicate people. It is true that some
nervous wear, such as you know well, from the excitement
of writing, may have made me more susceptible
to knife-like winds and sudden chills.</p>

<p>Though you tenderly forbade me to write in answer
to your letter, I like to do it in these minutes when I
happen to be free, lest hinderances should come in the
indefinite future. I am the happier for thinking that
you will have had this little bit of a letter to assure
you that the sweet rain of your affection did not fall
on a sandy place.</p>

<p>I make a delightful picture of your life in your
orange-grove&mdash;taken care of by dear daughters. Climate
enters into <em>my</em> life with an influence the reverse
of what I like to think of in yours. Sunlight and
sweet air make a new creature of me. But we cannot
bear now to exile ourselves from our own country,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
which holds the roots of our moral and social
life. One fears to become selfish and emotionally
withered by living abroad, and giving up the numerous
connections with fellow countrymen and women
whom one can further a little towards both public
and private good.</p>

<p>I wonder whether you ever suffered much from
false writing (about your biography and motives) in
the newspapers. I dare say that pro-slavery prints
did not spare you. But I should be glad to think
that there was less impudent romancing about you

about me as a stranger. But it is difficult for us
English, who have not spent any time in the United
States, to know the rank that is given to the various
newspapers; and we may make the mistake of giving
emphasis to some American journalism which is with
you as unknown to respectable minds as any low-class
newspaper with us.</p>

<p>When we come back from our journeying, I shall
be interesting myself in the MS. and proofs of my
husband's third volume of his Problems, which will
then go to press, and shall plunge myself into the
mysteries of our nervous tissue as the Professor has
been doing into the mysteries of the Middle Ages. I
have a cousinship with him in that taste&mdash;but how to
find space in one's life for all the subjects that solicit
one? My studies have lately kept me away from the
track of my husband's researches, and I feel behindhand
in my wifely sympathies. You know the pleasure
of such interchange&mdash;husband and wife each
keeping to their own work, but loving to have cognizance
of the other's course.</p>

<p>God bless you, dear friend. Beg the Professor to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
accept my affectionate respect, and believe me always
yours with love.</p>

you have expressed in words such as I most value.</p>

<p><i>June 10.</i>&mdash;We set off on our journey, intending to
go to San Martino Lantosc in the Maritime Alps.
But I was ill at Aix, where the heat had become oppressive,
and we turned northwards after making a
pilgrimage to Les Charmettes&mdash;stayed a few days at
Lausanne, then at Vevey, where again I was ill; then
by Berne and Zurich to Ragatz, where we were both
set up sufficiently to enjoy our life. After Ragatz to
Heidelberg, the Klönthal, Schaffhausen, St. Blasien
in the Black Forest, and then home by Strasburg,
Nancy, and Amiens, arriving September 1.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
John
Blackwood,
6th
July, 1876,
from Ragatz.</div>

<p>After much travelling we seem to have reached the
right place for our health and comfort, and as we
hope to stay here for at least a fortnight, I have begun
to entertain selfish thoughts about you and the possibility
of having news from you. Our month's absence
seems long to us&mdash;filled with various scenes and various
ailments&mdash;but to you, I dare say, the request for
a letter to tell us what has happened will seem to
have come before there is anything particular to tell.</p>

<p>On our arriving at Aix the effect of railway travelling
and heat on me warned us to renounce our project
of going to the Maritime Alps and to turn northward;
so after resting at Aix we went to Chambéry,
just to make a pilgrimage to Les Charmettes, and
then set our faces northward, staying at beautiful
Lausanne and Vevey for a week, and then coming on
by easy stages to this nook in the mountains. In
spite of illness we have had much enjoyment of the
lovely scenery we have been dwelling in ever since
we entered Savoy, where one gets what I most delight
in&mdash;the combination of rich, well-cultivated land,
friendly to man, and the grand outline and atmospheric
effect of mountains near and distant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>This place seems to be one of the quietest baths
possible. Such fashion as there is, is of a German,
unimposing kind; and the King of Saxony, who is at
the twin hotel with this, is, I imagine, a much quieter
kind of eminence than a London stock-broker. At
present the company seems to be almost exclusively
Swiss and German, but all the appliances for living
and carrying on the "cure" are thoroughly generous
and agreeable. We rose at five this morning, drank
our glasses of warm water, and walked till a quarter
to seven, then breakfasted; and from half-past eight
to eleven walked to Bad Pfeffers and back again,
along a magnificent ravine where the Tamine boils
down beneath a tremendous wall of rock, and where
it is interesting to see the electric telegraph leaping
from the summit, crossing the gulf, and then quietly
running by the roadside till it leaps upward again to
the opposite summit.</p>

<p>You may consider us as generally ill-informed, and
as ready to make much of a little news as any old
provincial folk in the days when the stage-coach
brought a single London paper to the village Crown
or Red Lion. We have known that Servia has declared
war against Turkey, and that Harriet Martineau
is dead as well as George Sand.</p>

<p>Our weather has been uniformly splendid since we
left Paris, with the exception of some storms, which
have conveniently laid the dust.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
John
Blackwood,
2d
Sept. 1876.</div>

<p>We reached home only last night, and had scarcely
taken our much-needed dinner before a parcel was
brought in which proved to be "Daniel Deronda" in
the four bound volumes, and various letters with other
"missiles"&mdash;as an acquaintance of mine once quite
naively called his own favors to his correspondents&mdash;which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
have at present only gone to swell a heap that
I mean to make acquaintance with very slowly. Mr.
Lewes, however, is more eager than I, and he has just
brought up to me a letter which has certainly gratified
me more than anything else of the sort I ever
received. It is from Dr. Hermann Adler, the Chief
Rabbi here, expressing his "warm appreciation of the
fidelity with which some of the best traits of the Jewish
character have been depicted by" etc., etc. I think
this will gratify you.</p>

<p>We are both the better for our journey, and I consider
myself in as good case as I can ever reasonably
expect. We can't be made young again, and must
not be surprised that infirmities recur in spite of
mineral waters and air 3000 feet above the sea-level.
After Ragatz, we stayed at Stachelberg and Klönthal&mdash;two
lovely places, where an English face is seldom
seen. Another delicious spot, where the air is fit for
the gods of Epicurus, is St. Blasien, in the Schwarzwald,
where also we saw no English or American
visitors, except such as <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">übernachten</i> there and pass on.
We have done exploits in walking, usually taking four
or five hours of it daily.</p>

<p>I hope that you and yours have kept well and have
enjoyed the heat rather than suffered from it. I confess
myself glad to think that this planet has not become
hopelessly chilly. Draughts and chills are my
enemies, and but for them I should hardly ever be
ailing.</p>

<p>The four volumes look very handsome on the outside.
Please thank Mr. William Blackwood for many
kind notes he wrote me in the days of MS. and proofs&mdash;not
one of which I ever answered or took notice of
except for my own behoof.

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Madame
Bodichon,
6th Sept.
1876.</div>

<p>We got home again last Friday, much strengthened
by our journey, notwithstanding vicissitudes. I suppose
you will not be in town for ages to come, but I
let you know that I am here in case you have anything
to say to me by letter&mdash;about "objects."</p>

<p>After leaving Ragatz we still kept in eastern Switzerland,
in high valleys unvisited by the English; and
in our homeward line of travel we paused in the
Schwarzwald at St. Blasien, which is a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Luft-kur</i>, all
green hills and pines, with their tops as still as if it
were the abode of the gods.</p>

<p>But imagine how we enjoy being at home again
in our own chairs, with the familiar faces giving
us smiles which are not expecting change in franc
pieces!</p>

<p>We are both pretty well, but of course not cured of
all infirmities. Death is the only physician, the shadow
of his valley the only journeying that will cure us
of age and the gathering fatigue of years. Still we
are thoroughly lively and "spry."</p>

<p>I hope that the hot summer has passed agreeably
for you and not been unfavorable to your health or
comfort. Of course a little news of you will be welcome,
even if you don't particularly want to say anything
to me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Madame

<p>My blessing on you for your sweet letter, which I
count among the blessings given to me. Yes. Women
can do much for the other women (and men) to
come. My impression of the good there is in all unselfish
efforts is continually strengthened. Doubtless
many a ship is drowned on expeditions of discovery
or rescue, and precious freights lie buried. But there
was the good of manning and furnishing the ship with
a great purpose before it set out.

<p>I have had some very interesting letters both from
Jews and from Christians about "Deronda." Part
of the scene at the club is translated into Hebrew in
a German-Jewish newspaper. On the other hand, a
Christian (highly accomplished) thanks me for embodying
the principles by which Christ wrought and
will conquer. This is better than the laudation of
readers who cut the book up into scraps, and talk of
nothing in it but Gwendolen. I meant everything in
the book to be related to everything else there.</p>

<p>I quite enter into Miss Jekyll's view of negative
beauty. Life tends to accumulate "messes" about
one, and it is hard to rid one's self of them because
of the associations attached. I get impatient sometimes,
and long, as Andrew Fairservice would say, to
"kaim off the fleas," as one does in a cathedral spoiled
by monuments out of keeping with the pillars and
walls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Wm.
Smith, 14th
Oct. 1876.</div>

<p>I had felt it long before you let me have some news
of you. How could you repeat deliberately that bad
dream of your having made yourself "objectionable?"
I will answer for it that you were never objectionable
to any creature except perhaps to your own self&mdash;a
too modest and shrinking self. I trusted in your understanding
last spring that I was glad to hear from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
my friends without having to make the effort of answering,
when answering was not demanded for practical
purposes. My health was not good, and I was
absorbed as to my working power, though not as to
my interest and sympathy.</p>

<p>You have been in my mind of late, not only on
your own account but in affectionate association with
our dear Mrs. Ruck, whose acquaintance I owe to
you.</p>

<p>On my return from abroad I found among my heap
of letters a delightful one from her, written, I think,
at the end of June, as bright and cheering as the hills
under the summer sky. And only a day or two after
we saw that sad news in the <cite>Times</cite>. I think of her
beautiful, open face, with the marks of grief upon it.
Why did you write me such a brief letter, telling me
nothing about your own life? I am a poor correspondent,
and have to answer many letters from people
less interesting to me than you are. Will you not
indulge me by writing more to me than you expect
me to write to you? That would be generous. We
both came back the better for our three months' journeying,
though I was so ill after we had got to the
south that we thought of returning, and went northward
in that expectation. But Ragatz set me up, so
far as I expect to be set up, and we greatly enjoyed
our fresh glimpses of Swiss scenery.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes is now printing his third volume of
"Problems of Life and Mind," and is, as usual, very
happy over his work. He shares my interest in
everything that relates to you; and be assured&mdash;will
you not?&mdash;that such interest will always be warm in
us. I shall not, while I live, cease to be yours affectionately.

<p>"Evermore thanks" for your last letter, full of generous
sympathy that can afford to be frank. The
lovely photograph of the grandson will be carefully
preserved. It has the sort of beauty which seems to
be peculiarly abundant in America, at once rounded
and delicate in form.</p>

<p>I do hope you will be able to carry out your wish
to visit your son at Bonn, notwithstanding that heavy
crown of years that your dear Rabbi has to carry. If
the sea voyage could be borne without much disturbance,
the land journey might be made easy by taking
it in short stages&mdash;the plan we always pursue in travelling.
You see I have an interested motive in wishing
you to come to Europe again, since I can't go to
America. But I enter thoroughly into the disinclination
to move when there are studies that make each
day too short. If we were neighbors, I should be in
danger of getting troublesome to the revered Orientalist,
with all kinds of questions.</p>

<p>As to the Jewish element in "Deronda," I expected
from first to last, in writing it, that it would create
much stronger resistance, and even repulsion, than it
has actually met with. But precisely because I felt
that the usual attitude of Christians towards Jews is&mdash;I
hardly know whether to say more impious or
more stupid when viewed in the light of their professed
principles, I therefore felt urged to treat Jews
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
with such sympathy and understanding as my nature
and knowledge could attain to. Moreover, not only
towards the Jews, but towards all Oriental peoples
with whom we English come in contact, a spirit of
arrogance and contemptuous dictatorialness is observable
which has become a national disgrace to us.
There is nothing I should care more to do, if it were
possible, than to rouse the imagination of men and
women to a vision of human claims in those races of
their fellow-men who most differ from them in customs
and beliefs. But towards the Hebrews we western
people, who have been reared in Christianity,
have a peculiar debt, and, whether we acknowledge it
or not, a peculiar thoroughness of fellowship in religious
and moral sentiment. Can anything be more
disgusting than to hear people called "educated"
making small jokes about eating ham, and showing
themselves empty of any real knowledge as to the relation
of their own social and religious life to the history
of the people they think themselves witty in insulting?
They hardly know that Christ was a Jew.
And I find men, educated, supposing that Christ
spoke Greek. To my feeling, this deadness to the
history which has prepared half our world for us, this
inability to find interest in any form of life that is not
clad in the same coat-tails and flounces as our own,
lies very close to the worst kind of irreligion. The
best that can be said of it is, that it is a sign of
the intellectual narrowness&mdash;in plain English, the
stupidity&mdash;which is still the average mark of our
culture.</p>

<p>Yes, I expected more aversion than I have found.
But I was happily independent in material things,
and felt no temptation to accommodate my writing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
any standard except that of trying to do my best in
what seemed to me most needful to be done, and I
sum up with the writer of the Book of Maccabees&mdash;"If
I have done well and as befits the subject, it is
what I desired; and if I have done ill, it is what I
could attain unto."</p>

<p>You are in the middle of a more glorious autumn
than ours, but we, too, are having now and then a little
sunshine on the changing woods. I hope that I
am right in putting the address from which you wrote
to me on the 25th September, so that my note may
not linger away from you, and leave you to imagine
me indifferent or negligent.</p>

<p>Please offer my reverent regard to Mr. Stowe.</p>

<p>We spent three months in East Switzerland, and
are the better for it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara
Hennell,

<p>Any one who knows from experience what bodily
infirmity is&mdash;how it spoils life even for those who
have no other trouble&mdash;gets a little impatient of
healthy complainants, strong enough for extra work
and ignorant of indigestion. I at least should be inclined
to scold the discontented young people who
tell me in one breath that they never have anything
the matter with them, and that life is not worth having,
if I did not remember my own young discontent.
It is remarkable to me that I have entirely lost my
<em>personal</em> melancholy. I often, of course, have melancholy
thoughts about the destinies of my fellow creatures,
but I am never in that <em>mood</em> of sadness which
used to be my frequent visitant even in the midst of
external happiness; and this, notwithstanding a very
vivid sense that life is declining and death close at
hand. We are waiting with some expectation for
Miss Martineau's Autobiography, which, I fancy, will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
be charming so far as her younger and less renowned
life extends. All biography diminishes in interest
when the subject has won celebrity&mdash;or some reputation
that hardly comes up to celebrity. But autobiography
at least saves a man or woman that the
world is curious about from the publication of a string
of mistakes called "Memoirs." It would be nice if
we could be a trio&mdash;I mean you, Cara, and I&mdash;chatting
together for an hour as we used to do when I
had walked over the hill to see you. But that pleasure
belongs to "the days that are no more." Will
you believe that an accomplished man some years
ago said to me that he saw no place for the exercise
of <em>resignation</em> when there was no personal divine will
contemplated as ordaining sorrow or privation? He
is not yet aware that he is getting old and needing
that unembittered compliance of soul with the inevitable
which seems to me a full enough meaning for
the word "resignation."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Journal,

<p><i>Dec. 1.</i>&mdash;Since we came home at the beginning of
September I have been made aware of much repugnance
or else indifference towards the Jewish part of
"Deronda," and of some hostile as well as adverse
reviewing. On the other hand, there have been the
strongest expressions of interest, some persons adhering
to the opinion, started during the early numbers,
that the book is my best. Delightful letters
have here and there been sent to me; and the sale
both in America and in England has been an unmistakable
guarantee that the public has been touched.
Words of gratitude have come from Jews and Jewesses,
and these are certain signs that I may have
contributed my mite to a good result. The sale hitherto
has exceeded that of "Middlemarch," as to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
£2 2<i>s.</i> four-volume form, but we do not expect an
equal success for the guinea edition which has lately
been issued.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 11.</i>&mdash;We have just bought a house in Surrey,
and think of it as making a serious change in our life&mdash;namely,
that we shall finally settle there and give
up town.</p>

<blockquote><p>This was a charming house&mdash;The Heights, Witley,
near Godalming. It stands on a gentle hill
overlooking a lovely bit of characteristic English
scenery. In the foreground green fields, prettily
timbered, undulate up to the high ground of Haslemere
in front, with Blackdown (where Tennyson
lives) on the left hand, and Hind Head on the
right&mdash;"Heights that laugh with corn in August,
or lift the plough-team against the sky in September."
Below, the white steam-pennon flies along
in the hollow. The walks and drives in the neighborhood
are enchanting. A land of pine-woods
and copses, village greens and heather-covered
hills, with the most delicious old red or gray brick,
timbered cottages nestling among creeping roses;
the sober-colored tiles of their roofs, covered with
lichen, offering a perpetual harmony to the eye.
The only want in the landscape is the want of
flowing water. About the house there are some
eight or nine acres of pleasure ground and gardens.
It quite fulfilled all expectations, as regards
beauty and convenience of situation, though I am
not quite sure that it was bracing enough for
health.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Journal,

<p><i>Dec. 15.</i>&mdash;At the beginning of this week I had deep
satisfaction from reading in the <cite>Times</cite> the report of a
lecture on "Daniel Deronda," delivered by Dr. Hermann
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Adler to the Jewish working-men&mdash;a lecture
showing much insight and implying an expectation of
serious benefit. Since then I have had a delightful
letter from the Jewish Theological Seminary at Breslau,
written by an American Jew named Isaacs, who
excuses himself for expressing his feeling of gratitude
on reading "Deronda," and assures me of his belief
that it has even already had an elevating effect on the
minds of some among his people&mdash;predicting that the
effect will spread.</p>

<p>I have also had a request from Signor Bartolommeo
Aquarone, of Siena, for leave to translate "Romola,"
and declaring that as one who has given special study
to the history of San Marco, and has written a life of
Fra Jeronimo Savonarola, he cares that "Romola"
should be known to his countrymen, for their good.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magnificat anima mea!</i> And last night I had a letter
from Dr. Benisch, editor of the <cite>Jewish Chronicle</cite>, announcing
a copy of the paper containing an article
written by himself on reading "Deronda" (there have
long ago been two articles in the same journal reviewing
the book), and using strong words as to the effect
the book is producing. I record these signs, that
I may look back on them if they come to be confirmed.</p>

in the illustrations required for uniformity. The illustrations
in the other volumes are, as Mr. Lewes
says, not queerer than those which amuse us in Scott
and Miss Austin, with one exception&mdash;namely, that
where Adam is making love to Dinah, which really
enrages me with its unctuousness. I would gladly
pay something to be rid of it. The next worst is that
of Adam in the wood with Arthur Donnithorne. The
rest are endurable to a mind well accustomed to resignation.
And the vignettes on the title-pages are
charming. But if an illustrator is wanted, I know one
whose work is exquisite&mdash;Mrs. Allingham.</p>

<p>This is not a moment for new ventures, but it will
take some time to prepare "Romola." I should like
to see proofs, feeling bound to take care of my text;
and I have lately been glancing into a book on Italian
things, where almost every citation I alighted on was
incorrectly printed. I have just read through the
cheap edition of "Romola," and though I have only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
made a few alterations of an unimportant kind&mdash;the
printing being unusually correct&mdash;it would be well for
me to send this copy to be printed from. I think it
must be nearly ten years since I read the book before,
but there is no book of mine about which I more
thoroughly feel that I could swear by every sentence
as having been written with my best blood, such as it
is, and with the most ardent care for veracity of which
my nature is capable. It has made me often sob with
a sort of painful joy as I have read the sentences which
had faded from my memory. This helps one to bear
false representations with patience; for I really don't
love any gentleman who undertakes to state my opinions
well enough to desire that I should find myself
all wrong in order to justify his statement.</p>

<p>I wish, whenever it is expedient, to add "The Lifted
Veil" and "Brother Jacob," and so fatten the volume
containing "Silas Marner," which would thus become
about 100 pages thicker.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes feels himself innocent of dialect in general,
and of Midland dialect in especial. Hence I
presume to take your reference on the subject as if
it had been addressed to me. I was born and bred
in Warwickshire, and heard the Leicestershire, North
Staffordshire, and Derbyshire dialects during visits
made in my childhood and youth. These last are
represented (mildly) in "Adam Bede." The Warwickshire
talk is broader, and has characteristics which
it shares with other Mercian districts. Moreover, dialect,
like other living things, tends to become mongrel,
especially in a central, fertile, and manufacturing region,
attractive of migration; and hence the Midland
talk presents less interesting relics of elder grammar
than the more northerly dialects.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps, unless a poet has a dialect ringing in his
ears, so as to shape his metre and rhymes according
to it at one jet, it is better to be content with a few
suggestive touches; and, I fear, that the stupid public
is not half grateful for studies in dialect beyond such
suggestions.</p>

<p>I have made a few notes, which may perhaps be not
unacceptable to you in the absence of more accomplished
aid:</p>

<p>1. The vowel always a double sound, the <em>y</em> sometimes
present, sometimes not; either <i>aäl</i> or <i>yaäl</i>.
<em>Hither</em> not heard except in <em>c'moother</em>, addressed to
horses.</p>

<p>2. <em>Thou</em> never heard. In general, the 2d person
singular not used in Warwickshire except occasionally
to young members of a family, and then always
in the form of <em>thee</em>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, <i>'ee</i>. For the <em>emphatic</em> nominative,
<em>yo</em>, like the Lancashire. For the accusative, <em>yer</em>,
without any sound of the <i>r</i>. The demonstrative <em>those</em>
never heard among the common people (unless when
caught by infection from the parson, etc.). <em>Self</em> pronounced
<i>sen</i>. The <em>f</em> never heard in <i>of</i>, nor the <em>n</em> in <i>in</i>.</p>

<p>3. Not year but 'ear. On the other hand, with the
usual "compensation," head is pronounced <i>y</i>ead.</p>

<p>4. "A gallows little chap as e'er ye see."</p>

<p class="hang2">5. Here's <em>to</em> you, maäster.<br />
Saäm to yo.</p>

<p>You must read Harriet Martineau's "Autobiography."
The account of her childhood and early youth
is most pathetic and interesting; but as in all books
of the kind, the charm departs as the life advances,
and the writer has to tell of her own triumphs. One
regrets continually that she felt it necessary not only
to tell of her intercourse with many more or less distinguished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
persons&mdash;which would have been quite
pleasant to everybody&mdash;but also to pronounce upon
their entire merits and demerits, especially when, if
she had died as soon as she expected, these persons
would nearly all have been living to read her gratuitous
rudenesses. Still I hope the book will do more
good than harm. Many of the most interesting little
stories in it about herself and others she had told me
(and Mr. Atkinson) when I was staying with her, almost
in the very same words. But they were all the better
for being told in her silvery voice. She was a charming
talker, and a perfect lady in her manners as a hostess.</p>

<p>We are only going to bivouac in our Surrey home
for a few months, to try what alterations are necessary.
We shall come back to this corner in the autumn. We
don't think of giving up London altogether at present,
but we may have to give up life before we come to
any decision on that minor point.</p>

<p>I have not read, and do not mean to read, Mrs.
Chapman's volume, so that I can judge of it only by
report. You seem to me to make a very good case
for removing the weight of blame from her shoulders
and transferring it to the already burdened back of
Harriet Martineau. But I confess that the more I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
think of the book and all connected with it, the more
it deepens my repugnance&mdash;or, rather, creates a new
repugnance in me&mdash;to autobiography, unless it can be
so written as to involve neither self-glorification nor
impeachment of others. I like that the "He, being
dead, yet speaketh," should have quite another meaning
than that. But however the blame may be distributed,
it remains a grievously pitiable thing to me
that man, or woman, who has cared about a future life
in the minds of a coming generation or generations,
should have deliberately, persistently mingled with
that prospect the ignoble desire to perpetuate personal
animosities, which can never be rightly judged
by those immediately engaged in them. And Harriet
Martineau, according to the witness of those well acquainted
with facts which she represents in her Autobiography,
was quite remarkably apt to have a false
view of her relations with others. In some cases she
gives a ridiculously inaccurate account of the tenor or
bearing of correspondence held with her. One would
not for a moment want to dwell on the weakness of a
character on the whole valuable and beneficent, if it
were not made needful by the ready harshness with
which she has inflicted pain on others.</p>

<p>No; I did not agree with you about the Byron case.
I understand by the teaching of my own egoism&mdash;and
therefore I can sympathize with&mdash;any act of self-vindicating
or vindictive rage under the immediate infliction
of what is felt to be a wrong or injustice. But I
have no sympathy with self-vindication, or the becoming
a proxy in vindication, deliberately bought at such
a price as that of vitiating revelations&mdash;which may
even possibly be false. To write a letter in a rage is
very pardonable&mdash;even a letter full of gall and bitterness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
meant as a sort of poisoned dagger. We poor
mortals can hardly escape these sins of passion. But
I have no pity to spare for the rancor that corrects
its proofs and revises, and lays it by chuckling with
the sense of its future publicity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Professor
Dr. David
Kaufmann,
31st May,
1877.</div>

<p>Hardly, since I became an author, have I had a
deeper satisfaction&mdash;I may say, a more heartfelt joy&mdash;than
you have given me in your estimate of "Daniel
Deronda."</p>

<p>I must tell you that it is my rule, very strictly observed,
not to read the criticisms on my writings. For
years I have found this abstinence necessary to preserve
me from that discouragement as an artist which
ill-judged praise, no less than ill-judged blame, tends
to produce in me. For far worse than any verdict as
to the proportion of good and evil in our work, is the
painful impression that we write for a public which
has no discernment of good and evil.</p>

<p>Certainly if I had been asked to choose <em>what</em> should
be written about my books, and <em>who</em> should write it,
I should have sketched&mdash;well, not anything so good
as what you have written, but an article which must
be written by a Jew who showed not merely a sympathy
with the best aspirations of his race, but a remarkable
insight into the nature of art and the processes
of the artistic mind.</p>

<p>Believe me, I should not have cared to devour even
ardent praise if it had not come from one who showed
the discriminating sensibility, the perfect response to
the artist's intention, which must make the fullest,
rarest joy to one who works from inward conviction
and not in compliance with current fashions.</p>

<p>Such a response holds for an author not only what
is best in "the life that now is," but the promise of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
"that which is to come." I mean that the usual approximative
narrow perception of what one has been
intending and profoundly feeling in one's work, impresses
one with the sense that it must be poor perishable
stuff, without roots to take any lasting hold in
the minds of men; while any instance of complete
comprehension encourages one to hope that the creative
prompting has foreshadowed and will continue
to satisfy a need in other minds.</p>

<p>Excuse me that I write but imperfectly, and perhaps
dimly, what I have felt in reading your article.
It has affected me deeply, and though the prejudice
and ignorant obtuseness which has met my effort to
contribute something towards the ennobling of Judaism
in the conceptions of the Christian community,
and in the consciousness of the Jewish community,
has never for a moment made me repent my choice,
but rather has been added proof that the effort was
needed&mdash;yet I confess that I had an unsatisfied hunger
for certain signs of sympathetic discernment which
you only have given.</p>

<p>I may mention as one instance your clear perception
of the relation between the presentation
of the Jewish elements and those of English social
life.</p>

<p>I write under the pressure of small hurries; for
we are just moving into the country for the summer,
and all things are in a vagrant condition around me.
But I wished not to defer answering your letter to an
uncertain opportunity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

Harrison,

<p>I am greatly indebted to you for your letter. It
has done something towards rousing me from what
I will not call self-despair but resignation to being
of no use.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>I wonder whether you at all imagine the terrible
pressure of disbelief in my own <big>{</big><sup><big>duty</big></sup>&frasl;<sub><big>right</big></sub><big>}</big> to speak to
the public, which is apt with me to make all beginnings
of work like a rowing against tide. Not that I
am without more than my fair ounce of self-conceit
and confidence that I know better than the critics,
whom I don't take the trouble to read, but who seem
to fill the air as with the smoke of bad tobacco.</p>

<p>But I will not dwell on my antithetic experiences.
I only mention them to show why your letter has done
me a service, and also to help in the explanation of my
mental attitude towards your requests or suggestions.</p>

<p>I do not quite understand whether you have in your
mind any plan of straightway constructing a liturgy to
which you wish me to contribute in a direct way. That
form of contribution would hardly be within my powers.
But your words of trust in me as possibly an organ
of feelings which have not yet found their due
expression is as likely as any external call could be to
prompt such perfectly unfettered productions as that
which you say has been found acceptable.</p>

<p>I wasted some time, three years ago, in writing
(what I do not mean to print) a poetic dialogue embodying
or rather shadowing very imperfectly the
actual contest of ideas. Perhaps what you have written
to me may promote and influence a different kind
of presentation. At any rate all the words of your
letter will be borne in mind, and will enter into my
motives.</p>

<p>We are tolerably settled now in our camping, experimental
fashion. Perhaps, before the summer is
far advanced, you may be in our neighborhood, and
come to look at us. I trust that Mrs. Harrison is by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
this time in her usual health. Please give my love to
her, and believe me always, with many grateful memories,
yours sincerely.</p>

I trust that you will by-and-by
be able to write me word of continued progress. Hardly
any bit of the kingdom, I fancy, would suit your
taste better than your neighborhood of the Land's
End. You are not fond of bushy midland-fashioned
scenery. We are enjoying the mixture of wildness
and culture extremely, and so far as landscape and
air go we would not choose a different home from
this. But we have not yet made up our minds whether
we shall keep our house or sell it.</p>

<p>Some London friends are also occasional dwellers
in these parts. The day before yesterday we had Mr.
and Mrs. Frederic Harrison, whose parents have a fine
old Tudor house&mdash;Sutton Place&mdash;some three miles
beyond Guildford. And do you remember Edmund
Gurney? He and his graceful bride lunched with us
the other day. And Miss Thackeray is married to-day
to young Ritchie. I saw him at Cambridge, and
felt that the nearly twenty years' difference between
them was bridged hopefully by his solidity and gravity.
This is one of several instances that I have
known of lately, showing that young men with even
brilliant advantages will often choose as their life's
companion a woman whose attractions are chiefly of
the spiritual order.</p>

<p>I trust it will not be otherwise than gratifying to
you to know that your stirring article on "Daniel
Deronda" is now translated into English by a son
of Professor Ferrier, who was a philosophical writer
of considerable mark. It will be issued in a handsomer
form than that of the pamphlet, and will appear
within this autumnal publishing season, Messrs.
Blackwood having already advertised it. Whenever
a copy is ready we shall have the pleasure of sending
it to you. There is often something to be borne with
in reading one's own writing in a translation, but I
hope that in this case you will not be made to wince
severely.</p>

<p>In waiting to send you this news, I seem to have
deferred too long the expression of my warm thanks
for your kindness in sending me the Hebrew translations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of Lessing and the collection of Hebrew
poems&mdash;a kindness which I felt myself rather presumptuous
in asking for, since your time must be well
filled with more important demands. Yet I must
further beg you, when you have an opportunity, to assure
Herr Bacher that I was most gratefully touched
by the sympathetic verses with which he enriched the
gift of his work.</p>

<p>I see by your last letter that your Theological Seminary
was to open on the 4th of this month, so that
this too retrospective letter of mine will reach you
when you are in the midst of your new duties. I
trust that this new institution will be a great good to
professor and students, and that your position is of a
kind that you contemplate as permanent. To teach
the young personally has always seemed to me the
most satisfactory supplement to teaching the world
through books; and I have often wished that I had
such a means of having fresh, living spiritual children
within sight.</p>

<p>One can hardly turn one's thought towards Eastern
Europe just now without a mingling of pain and dread,
but we mass together distant scenes and events in an
unreal way, and one would like to believe that the
present troubles will not at any time press on you in
Hungary with more external misfortune than on us in
England.</p>

and that you care to write to me, and though I will
not disobey your considerate prohibition so far as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
try to answer your letter fully, I must content my soul
by telling you that we shall be settled in the old place
by the end of the first week in November, and that I
shall be delighted to see you then. There are many
subjects that I shall have a special pleasure in talking
of with you.</p>

<p>Let me say now that the passage quoted from your
friend's letter is one that I am most glad to find falling
in with your own attitude of mind. The view is
what I have endeavored to represent in a little poem
called "Stradivarius," which you may not have happened
to read.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I say, not God Himself can make man's best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without best men to help Him.<br /></span>

<p>And next: I think direct personal portraiture&mdash;or
caricature&mdash;is a bastard kind of satire that I am not
disposed to think the better of because Aristophanes
used it in relation to Socrates. Do you know that
pretty story about Bishop Thirlwall? When somebody
wanted to bring to him Forchhammer as a distinguished
German writer, he replied, "No; I will
never receive into my house the man who justified the
death of Socrates!"</p>

<p>"O that we were all of one mind, and that mind
good!" is an impossible-to-be-realized wish: and I
don't wish it at all in its full extent. But I think it
would be possible that men should differ speculatively
as much as they do now, and yet be "of one mind"
in the desire to avoid giving unnecessary pain, in the
desire to do an honest part towards the general well-being,
which has made a comfortable <i>nidus</i> for themselves,
in the resolve not to sacrifice another to their
own egoistic promptings. Pity and fairness&mdash;two little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
words which, carried out, would embrace the utmost
delicacies of the moral life&mdash;seem to me not to
rest on an unverifiable hypothesis but on facts quite
as irreversible as the perception that a pyramid will
not stand on its apex.</p>

quiet. We love our bit of country and are bent on
keeping it as a summer refuge.</p>

<p><i>Apropos</i> of authorship, I was a little uneasy on Sunday
because I had seemed in the unmanageable current
of talk to echo a too slight way of speaking about
a great poet. I did not mean to say Amen when the
"Idylls of the King" seemed to be judged rather <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de
haut en bas</i>. I only meant that I should value for my
own mind "In Memoriam" as the chief of the larger
works; and that while I feel exquisite beauty in passages
scattered through the "Idylls," I must judge
some smaller wholes among the lyrics as the works
most decisive of Tennyson's high place among the
immortals.</p>

<p>Not that my deliverance on this matter is of any
moment, but that I cannot bear to fall in with the
sickening fashion of people who talk much about
writers whom they read little, and pronounce on a
great man's powers with only half his work in their
mind, while if they remembered the other half they
would find their judgments as to his limits flatly contradicted.
Then, again, I think Tennyson's dramas
such as the world should be glad of&mdash;and would be,
if there had been no prejudgment that he could not
write a drama.</p>

I have for two months and more been in better health
than I have known for several years. This pleasant

lawn-tennis as a daily exercise.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 10.</i>&mdash;We went to the Heights, Witley, at the

and returned to this old home on the 29th October.
We are at last in love with our Surrey house,
and mean to keep it. The air and abundant exercise
have quite renovated my health, and I am in more
bodily comfort than I have known for several years.
But my dear husband's condition is less satisfactory,
his headaches still tormenting him.</p>

<p>Since the year began several little epochs have
marked themselves. Blackwood offered for another
ten years' copyright of my works, the previous agreement
for ten years having expired. I declined, choosing
to have a royalty. G.'s third volume has been
well received, and has sold satisfactorily for a book
so little in the popular taste. A pleasant correspondence
has been opened with Professor Kaufmann,
now Principal of the Jewish Theological Seminary
at Pesth; and his "Attempt at an Appreciation of
'Daniel Deronda'" has been translated into English
by young Ferrier, son of Professor Ferrier.</p>

<p>A new Cabinet edition of my works, including
"Romola," has been decided on, and is being prepared;
and there have been multiplied signs that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
spiritual effect of "Deronda" is growing. In America
the book is placed above all my previous writings.</p>

<p>Having a more secure freedom than I may have
next week, I satisfy my eagerness to tell you that I
am longing for the news of you which you have accustomed
me to trust in as sure to come at this time

more than an affectionate greeting? You will
tell me how and where you have been, and what is

you can still interest yourself in writing on great subjects
without too much fatigue, and what companionship
is now the most precious to you? We returned
from our country home (with which we are much in
love) at the beginning of this month, leaving it earlier
than we wished because of the need to get workmen
into it. Our bit of Surrey has the beauties of Scotland
wedded to those of Warwickshire. During the
last two months of our stay there I was conscious of
more health and strength than I have known for several
years. Imagine me playing at lawn-tennis by the
hour together! The world I live in is chiefly one
that has grown around me in these later years, since
we have seen so little of each other. Doubtless we
are both greatly changed in spiritual as well as bodily
matters, but I think we are unchanged in the friendship

<p><i>Nov. 26.</i>&mdash;The other day we saw in the <cite>Times</cite> that

<p>I have been made rather unhappy by my husband's
impulsive proposal about Christmas. We are dull
old persons, and your two sweet young ones ought to
find each Christmas a new bright bead to string on
their memory, whereas to spend the time with us would
be to string on a dark, shrivelled berry. They ought
to have a group of young creatures to be joyful with.
Our own children always spend their Christmas with
Gertrude's family, and we have usually taken our
sober merry-making with friends out of town. Illness
among these will break our custom this year; and
thus <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein Mann</i>, feeling that our Christmas was free,
considered how very much he liked being with you,
omitting the other side of the question&mdash;namely, our
total lack of means to make a suitably joyous meeting,
a real festival, for Phil and Margaret. I was
conscious of this lack in the very moment of the proposal,
and the consciousness has been pressing on
me more and more painfully ever since. Even my
husband's affectionate hopefulness cannot withstand
my melancholy demonstration.</p>

<p>So pray consider the kill-joy proposition as entirely
retracted, and give us something of yourselves, only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
on simple black-letter days when the Herald Angels
have not been raising expectations early in the

yours ever.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 31.</i>&mdash;To-day I say a final farewell to this little
book, which is the only record I have made of my personal
life for sixteen years and more. I have often
been helped, in looking back in it, to compare former
with actual states of despondency, from bad health or
other apparent causes. In this way a past despondency
has turned to present hopefulness. But of
course, as the years advance, there is a new rational
ground for the expectation that my life may become
less fruitful. The difficulty is to decide how far resolution
should set in the direction of activity rather
than in the acceptance of a more negative state. Many
conceptions of work to be carried out present themselves,
but confidence in my own fitness to complete
them worthily is all the more wanting because it is
reasonable to argue that I must have already done
my best. In fact, my mind is embarrassed by the
number and wide variety of subjects that attract me,
and the enlarging vista that each brings with it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>
<p>I shall record no more in this book, because I am
going to keep a more business-like diary. Here ends
1877.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>Yes, it is a comfort to me, in the midst of so many
dispiriting European signs, that France has come so
far through her struggle. And no doubt you are rejoicing
too that London University has opened all its
degrees to women.</p>

<p>I think we know no reading more amusing than the
<cite>Times</cite> just now. We are deep among the gravities.
I have been reading aloud Green's first volume of his
new, larger "History of the English People;" and this
evening have begun Lecky's "History of England in
the Eighteenth Century"&mdash;in fact, we are dull old
fogies, who are ill-informed about anything that is going
on of an amusing kind. On Monday we took a
youth to the pantomime, but I found it a melancholy
business. The dear old story of Puss in Boots was
mis-handled in an exasperating way, and every incident
as well as pretence of a character turned into a
motive for the most vulgar kind of dancing. I came
away with a headache, from which I am only to-day
recovered. It is too cruel that one can't get anything
innocent as a spectacle for the children!</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes sends his best love, but is quite barren
of suggestions about books&mdash;buried in pink and lilac
periodicals of a physiological sort, and preoccupied
with the case of a man who has an artificial larynx,
with which he talks very well.</p>

<p>What do you say to the phonograph, which can
report gentlemen's bad speeches with all their stammering?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I like to think of you and Mrs. Blackwood taking
your daughter to Rome. It will be a delightful way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
of reviving memories, to mingle and compare them
with her fresh impressions, and in a spiritual sense to
have what Shakespeare says is the joy of having offspring&mdash;"to
see your blood warm while you feel it
cold." I wish that and all other prospects were not
marred by the threat of widening war.</p>

<p>Last night I finished reading Principal Tulloch's
small but full volume on "Pascal"&mdash;a present for
which I am much obliged. It is admirably fair and
dispassionate, and I should think will be an acceptable
piece of instruction to many readers. The brief
and graphic way in which he has made present and
intelligible the position of the Port Royalists is an
example of just what is needed in such a series as the
Foreign Classics. But of course they are the most
fortunate contributors who have to write about the
authors, less commonly treated of, and especially when
they are prepared to write by an early liking and long
familiarity&mdash;as in the present case. I have read every
line of appreciation with interest. My first acquaintance
with Pascal came from his "Pensées" being
given to me, as a school prize, when I was fourteen;
and I am continually turning to them now to revive
my sense of their deep though broken wisdom. It is
a pity that "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Bruyère</span>" cannot be done justice to
by any merely English presentation. There is a sentence
of his which touches with the finest point the
diseased spot in the literary culture of our time&mdash;"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le
plaisir de la critique nous ôté celui d'être vivement
touchés de tres belles choses.</span>" We see that our present
fashions are old, but there is this difference, that
they are followed by a greater multitude.</p>

<p>You may be sure I was very much cheered by your
last despatch&mdash;the solid unmistakable proof that my
books are not yet superfluous.

<p>As to my enjoyment of the "Two Grenadiers," it
would have been impossible but for the complete reduction
of it to symbolism in my own mind, and my
belief that it really touches nobody now, as enthusiasm
for the execrable Napoleon I. But I feel that the devotion
of the common soldier to his leader (the sign
for him of hard duty) is the type of all higher devotedness,
and is full of promise to other and better generations.</p>

The
Crown Prince is really a grand-looking man, whose
name you would ask for with expectation, if you
imagined him no royalty. He is like a grand antique

hands, and insisting that I should let him know when
we next came to Berlin, just as if he had been a Professor
Gruppe, living <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au troisième</i>. <em>She</em> is equally
good-natured and unpretending, liking best to talk of
nursing soldiers, and of what her father's taste was in
literature. She opened the talk by saying, "You
know my sister Louise"&mdash;just as any other slightly
embarrassed mortal might have done. We had a
picked party to dinner&mdash;Dean of Westminster, Bishop
of Peterborough, Lord and Lady Ripon, Dr. Lyon Playfair,
Kinglake (you remember "Eothen"&mdash;the old
gentleman is a good friend of mine), Froude, Mrs.
Ponsonby (Lord Grey's granddaughter), and two or
three more "illustrations;" then a small detachment
coming in after dinner. It was really an interesting

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I hope we are not wrong in imagining you settled
at Strathtyrum, with a fresh power of enjoying the old
scenes after your exile, in spite of the abstinence from
work&mdash;the chief sweetness of life. Mr. Lewes, too,
is under a regimen for gout, which casts its threatening
shadow in the form of nightly cramps and inward
<i>malaise</i>. He wants me to tell you something amusing&mdash;a
bit of Baboo English, from an Indian journal
sent us by Lord Lytton. <i>Apropos</i> of Sir G. Campbell's
rash statement that India was no good to England,
the accomplished writer says, "But British House
of Commons stripped him to pieces, and exposed his
<i>cui bono</i> in all its naked hideousness!" After all, I
think the cultivated Hindoo writing what he calls
English, is about on a par with the authors of leading
articles on this side of the globe writing what <em>they</em>
call English&mdash;accusing or laudatory epithets and
phrases, adjusted to some dim standard of effect
quite aloof from any knowledge or belief of their own.</p>

<p>Letter-writing, I imagine, is counted as "work" from
which you must abstain; and I scribble this letter
simply from the self-satisfied notion that you will like
to hear from me. You see I have asked no questions,
which are the torture-screws of correspondence,
hence you have nothing to answer. How glad I shall
be of an announcement that "No further bulletins will
be sent, Mr. Blackwood having gone to golf again."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I thought you understood that I have grave reasons
for not speaking on certain public topics. No request
from the best friend in the world&mdash;even from my own
husband&mdash;ought to induce me to speak when I judge
it my duty to be silent. If I had taken a contrary
decision, I should not have remained silent till now.
My function is that of the <em>æsthetic</em>, not the doctrinal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
teacher&mdash;the rousing of the nobler emotions, which
make mankind desire the social right, not the prescribing
of special measures, concerning which the artistic
mind, however strongly moved by social sympathy, is
often not the best judge. It is one thing to feel keenly
for one's fellow-beings; another to say, "This step,
and this alone, will be the best to take for the removal
of particular calamities."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I did hope that by the time your military evolutions
were over, we might see our way to enjoying the kind
welcome which you and Mrs. Blackwood have offered
us. No expedition attracts us more than the projected
visit to Strathtyrum. Unhappily, Mr. Lewes
continues to be troubled and depressed by symptoms
that, with the recollection upon us of the crippling
gout which once followed them, quite rob us of the
courage to leave home. The journey and the excitement,
which would be part of his pleasure if he were
tolerably well, seem to him now dangerous to encounter&mdash;and
I am not myself robust enough to venture
on a risk of illness to him; so that I cannot supply
the daring he needs. We begin to think that we shall
be obliged to defer our pleasure of seeing you in your
own home&mdash;so promising of walks and talks, such as
we can never have a chance of in London&mdash;until we
have the disadvantage of counting ourselves a year
older. I am very sorry. But it is better to know
that you are getting well, and we unable to see you,
than to think of you as an invalid, unable to receive
us. We must satisfy ourselves with the good we have&mdash;including
the peace, and the promise of an abundant
wheat harvest.</p>

<p>Please ask Mrs. and Miss Blackwood to accept my
best regards, and assure them that I counted much on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
a longer, quieter intercourse with them in a few sunny
days away from hotels and callers.</p>

you know how well I like to have a letter from you.</p>

<p>We have certainly to pay for all our other happiness,
which is a Benjamin's share, by many small bodily
miseries. Mr. Lewes continues ailing, and I am keeping
him company with headache. "Rejoice, O young
man, in the days of thy youth," and keep a reserve of
strength for the more evil days. Especially avoid
breaking your neck in hunting. Mr. Lewes did once
try horseback, some years ago, but found the exercise
too violent for him. I think a Highland sheltie would
be the suitable nag, only he is very fond of walking;
and between that and lawn-tennis he tires himself sufficiently.</p>

<p>You remember the case of the old woman of whom

fists." Well, I have been beaten into silence since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
your kind letter, partly by visitors and partly by continual
headache. I am a shade or two better this
morning, and my soul has half awaked to run its daily
stage of duty. Happily I was temporarily relieved
from headache during our friends' (the Tom Trollopes')
visit. We took them to see Tennyson, and they were
delighted with the reading which he very amiably gave
us. Then the Du Mauriers came to dine with us on
the Thursday, and so the time was not, I hope, too languid
for our visitors.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes continues to show improvement in health,
so that the balance of good is not much altered by my
deficit.</p>

<p>We shall be pleased to have any news of you, whether
by post or person.</p>

<blockquote><p>At this time I was in the habit of going over
occasionally from Weybridge on Sundays. The
shadow of trouble was on both our houses. My
mother was in her last illness, and Mr. Lewes was
constantly ailing, though none of us then thought
that he would be taken first. But the sharing of a
common anxiety contributed to make our friendship
much more intimate. In our drives in the
neighborhood of Witley, Mr. Lewes used sometimes
to be suddenly seized with severe cramping pains.
I think he was himself aware that something was
far wrong, but the moment the pain ceased the
extraordinary buoyancy of his spirits returned.
Nothing but death could quench that bright flame.
Even on his worst days he had always a good story
to tell; and I remember on one occasion, between
two bouts of pain, he sang through, with great <i>brio</i>,
though without much voice, the greater portion of
the tenor part in the "Barber of Seville"&mdash;George
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Eliot playing his accompaniment, and both of them
thoroughly enjoying the fun.</p>

<p>They led a very secluded life at Witley&mdash;as always
in their country retreats&mdash;but enjoyed the society
of some of their neighbors. Sir Henry and
Lady Holland, who lived next door; charming
Mrs. Thellusson and her daughter, Mrs. Greville,
who lived between Witley and Godalming, were especial
friends. The Tennysons, too, and the Du
Mauriers and Allinghams, were all within easy
visiting distance. George Eliot's dislike of London
life continued to increase with the increasing
number of her acquaintance, and consequent demands
on time. The Sunday receptions, confined
to a small number of intimate friends in 1867, had
gradually extended themselves to a great variety
of interesting people.</p>

<p>These receptions have been so often and so well
described that they have hitherto occupied rather
a disproportionate place in the accounts of George
Eliot's life. It will have been noticed that there is
very little allusion to them in the letters; but,
owing to the seclusion of her life, it happened that
the large majority of people who knew George
Eliot as an author never met her elsewhere. Her
<i>salon</i> was important as a meeting-place for many
friends whom she cared greatly to see, but it was
not otherwise important in her own life. For she
was eminently <em>not</em> a typical mistress of a <i>salon</i>. It
was difficult for her, mentally, to move from one
person to another. Playing around many disconnected
subjects, in talk, neither interested her nor
amused her much. She took things too seriously,
and seldom found the effort of entertaining compensated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
by the gain. Fortunately Mr. Lewes supplied
any qualities lacking in the hostess. A brilliant
talker, a delightful <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raconteur</i>, versatile, full of
resource in the social difficulties of amalgamating
diverse groups, and bridging over awkward pauses,
he managed to secure for these gatherings most
of the social success which they obtained. Many
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réunions</i> were exceedingly agreeable and interesting,
especially when they were not too crowded,
when general conversation could be maintained.
But the larger the company grew the more difficult
it was to manage. The English character does
not easily accommodate itself to the exigencies of
a <i>salon</i>. There is a fatal tendency to break up
into small groups. The entertainment was frequently
varied by music when any good performer
happened to be present. I think, however, that
the majority of visitors delighted chiefly to come
for the chance of a few words with George Eliot
alone. When the drawing-room door of the Priory
opened, a first glance revealed her always in the
same low arm-chair on the left-hand side of the
fire. On entering, a visitor's eye was at once arrested
by the massive head. The abundant hair,
streaked with gray now, was draped with lace, arranged
mantilla-fashion, coming to a point at the
top of the forehead. If she were engaged in conversation
her body was usually bent forward with
eager, anxious desire to get as close as possible to
the person with whom she talked. She had a great
dislike to raising her voice, and often became so
wholly absorbed in conversation that the announcement
of an incoming visitor sometimes failed to attract
her attention; but the moment the eyes were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
lifted up, and recognized a friend, they smiled a
rare welcome&mdash;sincere, cordial, grave&mdash;a welcome
that was felt to come straight from the heart, not
graduated according to any social distinction. Early
in the afternoon, with only one or two guests, the
talk was always general and delightful. Mr. Lewes
was quite as good in a company of three as in a
company of thirty. In fact, he was better, for his
<i>verve</i> was not in the least dependent on the number
of his audience, and the flow was less interrupted.
Conversation was no effort to him; nor
was it to her so long as the numbers engaged were
not too many, and the topics were interesting enough
to sustain discussion. But her talk, I think, was
always most enjoyable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à deux</i>. It was not produced
for effect, nor from the lip, but welled up
from a heart and mind intent on the one person
with whom she happened to be speaking. She was
never weary of giving of her best so far as the wish
to give was concerned. In addition to the Sundays
"at home" the Priory doors were open to a small
circle of very intimate friends on other days of the
week. Of evening entertainments there were very
few, I think, after 1870. I remember some charming
little dinners&mdash;never exceeding six persons&mdash;and
one notable evening when the Poet Laureate
read aloud "Maud," "The Northern Farmer," and
parts of other poems. It was very interesting on
this occasion to see the two most widely known
representatives of contemporary English literature
sitting side by side. George Eliot would have enjoyed
much in her London life if she had been
stronger in health, but, with her susceptible organization,
the <em>atmosphere</em> oppressed her both physically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and mentally. She always rejoiced to escape
to the country. The autumn days were beginning
to close in now on the beautiful Surrey landscape,
not without some dim, half-recognized presage to
her anxious mind of impending trouble.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am not inclined to let you rest any longer without
asking you to send me some account of yourself, for it
is long since I got my last news from Edinburgh. I
should like to know that you have continued to gather
strength, and that you have all been consequently
more and more enjoying your life at Strathtyrum. It
is an ugly theory that happiness wants the contrast of
illness and anxiety, but I know that Mrs. Blackwood
must have a new comfort in seeing you once more with
your usual strength.</p>

<p>We have had "a bad time" in point of health, and
it is only quite lately that we have both been feeling a
little better. The fault is all in our own frames, not
in our air or other circumstances; for we like our
house and neighborhood better and better. The general
testimony and all other arguments are in favor of
this district being thoroughly healthy. But we both
look very haggard in the midst of our blessings.</p>

One's hopes for the world's getting a little rest from
war are continually checked. Every day, after reading
the <cite>Times</cite>, I feel as if all one's writing were miserably
trivial stuff in the presence of this daily history. Do
you think there are persons who admire Russia's "mission"

James Paget's assurances that the actual trouble will
be soon allayed.</p>

<p>I have been telling the patient about your letter and
suggestion that he should send a form of slip as advertisement
for the Magazine. He says&mdash;and the answer
seems to have been a matter of premeditation with
him&mdash;that it will be better not to announce the book
in this way at once&mdash;"the Americans and Germans
will be down on us." I cannot question him further
at present, but I have no doubt he has been thinking
about the matter, and we must not cross his wish in
any way.</p>

<p>I have thought that a good form of advertisement,
to save people from disappointment in a book of
mine not being a story, would be to print the list of
contents, which, with the title, would give all but the
very stupid a notion to what form of writing the work
belongs. But this is a later consideration. I am glad
you were pleased with the opening.</p>

<p>For the last week I have been in deep trouble. Mr.
Lewes has been alarmingly ill. To-day Sir James

better, and I am for the first time comforted. You

<p>Mr. Lewes continues sadly ill, and I am absorbed
in nursing him. When he wrote about Parliament
meeting, he was thinking that it would be called together
at the usual time&mdash;perhaps February. The
book can be deferred without mischief. I wish to add
a good deal, but, of course, I can finish nothing now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
until Mr. Lewes is better. The doctors pronounced
him in every respect better yesterday, and he had a
quiet night, but since five o'clock this morning he has
had a recurrence of trouble. You can feel for him and
me, having so lately known what severe illness is.<br /><br /></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>


<blockquote><p>For many weeks after Mr. Lewes's death, George
Eliot saw no one except Mr. Charles Lewes, and
the very few persons she was obliged to receive on
necessary business. She read no letters, and wrote
none, but at once began to occupy herself busily
with Mr. Lewes's unfinished MSS., in which work
Mr. Charles Lewes was able to assist her in the arrangement.
The only entry in her diary on the 1st
January, 1879, is "Here I and sorrow sit." At
the end of two months this desolation had told terribly
on her health and spirits; and on the last day
of January she was greatly comforted by a visit from
Sir James Paget&mdash;a friend for whom she had always
had the highest and most cordial regard during
the many years she had known him. Meantime
she had begun to write a few short notes, and she
mentions in her journal of 2d January, "A kind
letter from Professor Michael Foster, of Cambridge,
offering to help me on any physiological point;"
and on the 19th January, "Ruminating on the
founding of some educational instrumentality as a
memorial to be called by his name." There are
the following letters in January and February.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was a long while before I read any letters, and as
yet I have written none, except such as business required
of me. You will believe that this has not been
for want of gratitude to all my friends for their goodness
to me. I can trust to your understanding of a
sorrow which has broken my life. I write now because
I ought not to allow any disproportionate expense to
be incurred about my printed sheets.</p>

<p>To me, now, the writing seems all trivial stuff, but
since he wished it to be printed, and you seem to concur,
I will correct the sheets (if you will send me the
remainder) gradually as I am able, and they can be
struck off and laid by for a future time. I submit this
proposition to your judgment, not knowing what may
be most expedient for your printing-office.</p>

<p>When I said "sometime" I meant still a distant

can go through anything that is mere business. But
what used to be joy is joy no longer, and what is
pain is easier because he has not to bear it.</p>

<p>Bless you for your loving thought. But for all reasons,
bodily and mental, I am unable to move. I am
entirely occupied with his manuscripts, and must be
on this spot among all the books. Then, I am in a
very ailing condition of body&mdash;cannot count on myself
from day to day&mdash;and am not fit to undertake any

<p>I do need your affection. Every sign of care for me
from the beings I respect and love is a help to me.
In a week or two I think I shall want to see you.
Sometimes, even now, I have a longing, but it is immediately
counteracted by a fear. The perpetual
mourner&mdash;the grief that can never be healed&mdash;is innocently
enough felt to be wearisome by the rest of the
world. And my sense of desolation increases. Each

<p>A transient absence of mind yesterday made me speak

<div class="sidenote">Letter

<p>Pray do not announce "Theophrastus" in any way.
It would be intolerable to my feelings to have a book
of my writing brought out for a long while to come.
What I wish to do is, to correct the sheets thoroughly,
and then have them struck off and laid by till the time
of publication comes. One reason which prompted
me to set about the proofs&mdash;in addition to my scruples
about occupying the type&mdash;was that I was feeling so
ill, I thought there was no time to be lost in getting
done everything which no one else would do if I left
it undone. But I am getting better, I think; and my
doctors say there is nothing the matter with me to
urge more haste than the common uncertainty of life
urges on us all.</p>

<p>There is a great movement now among the Jews
towards colonizing Palestine, and bringing out the resources
of the soil. Probably Mr. Oliphant is interested
in the work, and will find his experience in the West
not without applicability in the East.</p>

<p>It is a satisfaction to you, I hope, that your son is
about to be initiated in George Street. I trust he will
one day carry on the good traditions of the name
"John Blackwood."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Madame
Bodichon,
5th Mch. 1879.</div>

<p>Your letter, which tells me that you are benefiting by
the clear, sunny air, is very welcome. Yes, here too
the weather is more merciful, and I drive out most
days. I am better bodily, but I never feel thoroughly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
comfortable in that material sense, and I am incredibly
thin. As to my mind, I am full of occupation, but the
sorrow deepens down instead of diminishing. I mean
to go to Witley in a few months, that I may look again
on the spots that he enjoyed, and that we enjoyed together,
but I cannot tell beforehand whether I shall
care to go again afterwards.</p>

<p>Everybody is very kind to me, and by and by I shall
begin to see a few intimate friends. I can do or go
through anything that is business or duty, but time and
strength seem lacking for everything else. You must
excuse my weakness, remembering that for nearly
twenty-five years I have been used to find my happiness
in his. I can find it nowhere else. But we can
live and be helpful without happiness, and I have had
more than myriads who were and are better fitted for it.</p>

<p>I am really very busy, and have been sadly delayed
by want of health. One project I have entered on is
to found a studentship, which will be called after his
name. I am getting help from experienced men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John

5th
Mch. 1879.</div>

<p>I send the corrected sheets of "Theophrastus," and
shall be much obliged if you will order a complete revise
to be sent me before they are struck off. Whenever
the book is published (I cannot contemplate its
appearing before June, and if that is a bad time it must
stand over till the autumn season) I beg you kindly to
write for me a notice, to be printed on the fly-leaf, that
the MS. was placed in your hands last November, or
simply last year.</p>

<p>I think you will enter into my feeling when I say that
to create a notion on the part of the public of my having
been occupied in writing "Theophrastus" would
be repugnant to me. And I shrink from putting myself
forward in any way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>I hope you are benefiting by the milder weather. I
drive out a little now, but you must be prepared to see
me a much changed creature. I think I should hardly
know myself.</p>

<p>After weighing what you have said, I agree to the
publication of "Theophrastus" in May. If you had at
all suspected that the book would injure my influence,
you would not have wished me to give it forth in its
present form, and in the uncertainty of one's inner and
outer life it is not well to depend on future capabilities.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
There are some things in it which I want to get said,
and if the book turned out to be effective in proportion
to my other things, the form would lend itself to a
"second series"&mdash;supposing I lived and kept my faculties.</p>

<p>As to the price for the right of translating, you will
judge. If you will kindly undertake these negotiations
for me, I shall be thankful. And pray remember that
I don't <em>want</em> the book to be translated, so that it will
be well to wait for the application, and to ask a sufficient
sum to put the publisher on his guard as to the
selection of a translator. But, of course, this little
book cannot be paid for according to the difficulty of
translation.</p>

<p>You see, I have been so used to have all trouble
spared me that I am ready to cast it on any willing
shoulders. But I am obliged now to think of business
in many ways.</p>

<p>I am so glad to know that Mrs. Blackwood has the
comfort of a good report about you from the doctors.
Perhaps it may seem to you the wrong order of sympathy
to be glad for your sake in the <em>second</em> place.</p>

8th April,

<p>Your letter was very welcome this morning, for I do
not like to be very long without having some picture
of you, and your words of affection are always sweet.</p>

<p>The studentship I mention is to supply an income
to a young man who is qualified and eager to carry on
physiological research, and would not otherwise have
the means of doing so. Mr. H. Sidgwick, Michael
Foster, and other men of kindred mind are helping
me in settling the scheme. I have been determined
in my choice of the studentship by the idea of what
would be a sort of prolongation of <em>his</em> life. That there
should always, in consequence of his having lived, be
a young man working in the way he would have liked
to work, is a memorial of him that comes nearest my
feeling. It is to be at Cambridge to begin with, and
we thought at first of affiliating it to the university;
but now the notion is that it will be well to keep it
free, so that the trustees may move it where and when
they will. But the scheme is not yet drafted.</p>

<p>I am going to bring out one of "The Problems" in
a separate volume at the beginning of May, and am
now correcting the proofs.</p>

<p>My going to Witley is an experiment. I don't
know how I shall bear being there, but I hope there
will be nothing to hinder my <em>having you</em> there if you
will undertake the troublous journey for my sake.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John

<p>I enclose the proof of title-page and motto. Whether
the motto (which is singularly apt and good) should be
on the title-page or fly-leaf I leave you to judge. Certainly,
everybody who does not read Latin will be offended
by its claiming notice, and will consider that
only the deepest-dyed pedantry could have found the
motive for it. But I will not leave it out altogether.</p>

<p>I have had such various letters from time to time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
asking me to reprint or write essays, that, perhaps,
some of the public will not be disappointed that the
volume is not a story. But that must be as it may;
and if you think the acceptance dubious, it is much
the better plan not to stereotype.</p>

<p>What energy there is in Mr. Kinglake in spite of the
somewhat shattered health that his <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wesen</i> gives one
the impression of! Among incidents of war that one
can dwell on with anything like gladness, that account
of the rescue of the colors at Isandlana is memorable,
is it not?</p>

<p>I go out every day, drive beyond the ranks of hideous
houses in the Kilburn outskirts, and get to lanes
where I can walk, in perfect privacy, among the fields
and budding hedgerows.</p>

<p>I hope Mr. Julian Sturgis will take care of his writing
and do something lasting. He seems to me to
have a strain above the common in him; and he is
not writing for his bread, or even his butter. I don't
know why I say this just now, except that I had it in
my mind to say long ago, and it has just come upper-most
as I was thinking of the Magazine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Professor
Kaufmann,
17th April,
1879.</div>

<p>Your kind letter has touched me very deeply. I
confess that my mind had, more than once, gone out
to you as one from whom I should like to have some
sign of sympathy with my loss. But you were rightly
inspired in waiting till now, for during many weeks I
was unable even to listen to the letters which my generous
friends were continually sending me. Now, at
last, I am eagerly interested in every communication
that springs out of an acquaintance with my husband
and his works.</p>

<p>I thank you for telling me about the Hungarian
translation of his "History of Philosophy;" but what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
would I not have given if the volumes could have come,
even only a few days, before his death! For his mind
was perfectly clear, and he would have felt some joy
in that sign of his work being effective.</p>

<p>I do not know whether you will enter into the comfort
I feel that he never knew he was dying, and fell
gently asleep after ten days of illness, in which the
suffering was comparatively mild.</p>

<p>One of the last things he did at his desk was to despatch
a manuscript of mine to the publishers. The
book (not a story, and not bulky) is to appear near the
end of May, and, as it contains some words I wanted
to say about the Jews, I will order a copy to be sent
to you.</p>

<p>I hope that your labors have gone on uninterruptedly
for the benefit of others, in spite of public troubles.
The aspect of affairs with us is grievous&mdash;industry languishing,
and the best part of our nation indignant at
our having been betrayed into an unjustifiable war in
South Africa.</p>

<p>I have been occupied in editing my husband's MSS.,
so far as they are left in sufficient completeness to be
prepared for publication without the obtrusion of another
mind instead of his. A brief volume on "The
Study of Psychology" will appear immediately, and a
further volume of psychological studies will follow in
the autumn. But his work was cut short while he still
thought of it as the happy occupation of far-stretching
months. Once more let me thank you for remembering
me in my sorrow.</p>

<p>I am in dreadful need of your counsel. Pray come

<blockquote><p>From this time forward I saw George Eliot constantly.
My mother had died in the beginning of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
previous December, a week after Mr. Lewes; and,
as my life had been very much bound up with hers,
I was trying to find some fresh interest in taking
up a new pursuit. Knowing very little Italian, I
began Dante's "Inferno" with Carlyle's translation.
The first time I saw George Eliot afterwards,
she asked me what I was doing, and, when I told
her, exclaimed, "Oh, I must read that with you."
And so it was. In the following twelve months we
read through the "Inferno" and the "Purgatorio"
together; not in a <i>dilettante</i> way, but with minute
and careful examination of the construction of every
sentence. The prodigious stimulus of such a teacher
(<i>cotanto maestro</i>) made the reading a real labor
of love. Her sympathetic delight in stimulating my
newly awakened enthusiasm for Dante did something
to distract her mind from sorrowful memories.
The divine poet took us into a new world. It was
a renovation of life. At the end of May I induced
her to play on the piano at Witley for the first
time; and she played regularly after that whenever
I was there, which was generally once or twice
a week, as I was living at Weybridge, within easy
distance.</p>

<p>Besides Dante, we read at this time a great many
of Sainte-Beuve's "Causeries," and much of Chaucer,
Shakespeare, and Wordsworth. But I am anticipating.
We will return to the correspondence
in its order.</p></blockquote>

<p>When I shall be able to get to Witley is altogether
uncertain. The cold winds make one less hungry for
the country, but still it will be a relief to me, in some
respects, to get away from town. I am much stronger

life of ours. But I am obliged to keep my doors
closed against all but the few until I go away. You,
however, I shall hope to see. I am founding a studentship
of Physiology, to be called "The George
Henry Lewes Studentship." It will be placed, in the
first instance, at Cambridge, where there is the best
physiological school in the kingdom. But the trustees
(with my consent during my life) will have the power
of moving it where they judge best. This idea, which
I early conceived, has been a great stay to me. But
I have plenty to think of, plenty of creatures depending
on me, to make my time seem of some value. And
there are so many in the world who have to live without
any great enjoyment.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes always wrote the dramatic criticisms in
the <cite>Leader</cite>, and for a year or two he occasionally wrote
such criticisms in the <cite>Pall Mall</cite>. Of the latter, the
chief were reprinted in the little book on "Actors,
and the Art of Acting." What was written in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
<cite>Fortnightly</cite> (1865-66) is marked by signature. The
most characteristic contributions to the <cite>Cornhill</cite> (1864-65)
were "The Mental Condition of Babies," "Dangers
and Delights of Tobacco," "Was Nero a Monster?"
"Shakespeare in France," and "Miseries of a
Dramatic Author."</p>

<p>But after 1866 his contributions to any periodical
were very scanty&mdash;confined to a few articles in the
<cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>, one on "The Reign of Law," in
the <cite>Fortnightly</cite>, and the series on Darwin, now incorporated
in "The Physical Basis of Mind." After these,
his sole contributions were an article on Dickens
(1872), two on "Spiritualism" and "Mesmerism"
(1876), and one on "The Dread and Dislike of Science"
(1878).</p>

<p>Charles, I think, mentioned to you my desire that
you should do me the valuable service of looking over
the proofs of the remaining volume of "Problems," and
you were so generous as to express your willingness
to undertake that labor. The printing will not begin
till after the 16th&mdash;Dr. Michael Foster, who has also
kindly offered to help me in the same way, not being
sufficiently at leisure till after that date.</p>

<p>I have been rather ill again lately, but am hoping to
benefit by the country quietude. You, too, I am sorry
to hear, are not over strong. This will make your loan
of mind and eyesight all the more appreciated by me.</p>

<p>Your letter, full of details&mdash;just the sort of letter I
like to have&mdash;has been among my comforts in these
last damp, chill days. The first week I was not well,
and had a troublesome attack of pain, but I am better,
and try to make life interesting by always having something
to do.</p>

<p>I am greatly obliged to you for sending me the
paper you are to read to-day; and I appreciate it the
more highly because your diligence is in contrast with
the general sluggishness of readers about any but idle
reading. It is melancholy enough that to most of our
polite readers the social factor in psychology would be
a dull subject; for it is certainly no conceit of ours
which pronounces it to be the supremely interesting
element in the thinking of our time.</p>

<p>I confess the word factor has always been distasteful
to me as the name for the grandest of forces. If
it were only mathematical I should not mind, but it
has many other associated flavors which spoil it for me.</p>

<p>Once more&mdash;ever more&mdash;thanks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>You will like to know that Mr. Frederic Harrison
has sent me a brief paper, which is to be read to-day
at the Metaphysical Society, on the "Social Factor in
Psychology," opening with a quotation from the "Study
of Psychology," and marking throughout his high appreciation
of your father's work. Also the Rector of
Lincoln College, Oxford, kindly sent (with his initials
only) to Trübner four errata which he had found in
reading the "Study of Psychology." Trübner did not
know who was the kind corrector, and very properly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
sent the paper to me, offering to have the corrections
made on the plates if I wished it. I said, "By all
means," and have written to thank the Rector. What
a blessing to find a man who really reads a book!</p>

<p>I have received the enclosed letter, with other papers
(about country lodgings at Sevenoaks for poor children).
Will you look out a single copy of as many of
my books (poems included) as you can find, and send
them in a parcel, saying that they come from me for
the Free Library? Please not to mind this trouble, as
it is for the <em>impecunious</em> readers. (You know I am
nothing if not "sesquipedalian" and scientific; and a
word of five syllables will do for both qualities.)</p>

<p>I wish you could see Coquelin in Tabourin. He is
a wonderful actor, when he gets the right part for him.
He has a penetrating personality that one cannot be
indifferent to, though possibly it may be unpleasant to
some people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I was beginning, with my usual apprehensiveness, to
fear that you had no good news to tell me, since I did
not hear from you, and I should have gone on fearing
till to-morrow morning if I had not happened to drive
to Godalming and ask for the second post. We only
get one post a day at the benighted Witley, so that if
you want me to get a letter quickly it must be posted
early at Edinburgh.</p>

<p>I am heartily glad to know that the invalid is going
on well, and I trust that the softer air we are having
now will help him forward.</p>

<p>"Theophrastus" seems to be really welcomed by
the public. Mr. Blackwood will be amused to hear
that one gentleman told Charles, or implied, that
"Theophrastus" was a higher order of book, and <em>more
difficult to write</em> than a novel. Wait long enough, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
every form of opinion will turn up. However, poor
"Theophrastus" is certainly not composed of "chips"
any more than my other books.</p>

<p>Another amusing bit of news is, that the other day
Mrs. Pattison sent me an extract from the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">livret</i> of the
Paris <i>Salon</i>, describing a picture painted by a French
artist from "The Lifted Veil," and representing the
moment when the resuscitated woman, fixing her eyes
on her mistress, accuses her of having poisoned her
husband. I call this amusing&mdash;I ought rather to have
said typical of the relation my books generally have
with the French mind.</p>

<p>Thank you for sending me the list of orders. It does
interest me to see the various country demands. I
hope the movement will continue to cheer us all, and
you are sure to let me know everything that is pleasant,
so I do not need to ask for that kindness.</p>

<p>The weather is decidedly warmer, and Tuesday was
a perfectly glorious day. But rain and storm have
never let us rest long together. I am not very bright,
and am ready to interpret everything in the saddest
sense, but I have no definite ailment.</p>

<p>My best regards to the convalescent, who, I have
no doubt, will write to me when he is able to do so.
But I am only one of many who will be glad to hear
from him.</p>

<p>I have been having my turn of illness of rather a sharp
kind. Yesterday, when your letter came, I was in more
acute pain than I have ever known in my life before,
but before the morning was over I was sufficiently relieved
to read your pleasant news. I am writing in
bed, but am in that most keenly conscious ease which
comes after unusual suffering. The way in which the
public takes "Theophrastus" is really a comfort to
me. I have had some letters, not of the complimentary,
but of the grateful kind, which are an encouragement
to believe in the use of writing. But you would
be screamingly amused with one, twenty-three pages
long (from an Edinburgh man, by-the-bye), who has
not read the book, but has read of it, and thinks that
his own case is still more worthy of presentation than
Merman's.</p>

<p>I think a valuable series (or couple of volumes)
might be made up from "Maga" of articles written
<em>hot</em> by travellers and military men, and not otherwise
republished&mdash;chronicles and descriptions by eye-witnesses&mdash;which
might be material for historians.</p>

<p>What a comfort that the Afghan war is concluded!
But on the back of it comes the black dog of Indian

<p>Your description of the effects you feel from the
restless, tormenting winds would serve well to represent
my experience too. It seems something incredible
written in my memory that when I was a little girl I
loved the wind&mdash;used to like to walk about when it
was blowing great guns. And now the wind is to me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
what it was to early peoples&mdash;a demon-god, cruelly demanding
all sorts of human sacrifices. Thank you,
dear, for caring whether I have any human angels to
guard me. None are permanently here except my
servants, but Sir James Paget has been down to see
me, I have a very comfortable country practitioner to
watch over me from day to day, and there is a devoted
friend who is backward and forward continually to see
that I lack nothing.</p>

<p>It is a satisfaction to me that you felt the need for
"Debasing the Moral Currency" to be written. I
was determined to do it, though it might make me a
stone of stumbling and rock of offence to all the comic
tribe.</p>

I am deeply touched by the account of its origin, and
I remember well everything you said to me of Mr.
Brown in old days when he was still with you. I had
only cut a very little way into the volume when a friend
came and carried it off, but my eyes had already been
arrested by some remarks on the character of Harold
Transome, which seemed to me more penetrating and
finely felt than almost anything I have read in the way
of printed comment on my own writing. When my
friend brings back the volume I shall read it reverentially,
and most probably with a sense of being usefully
admonished. For praise and sympathy arouse
much more self-suspicion and sense of shortcoming
than all the blame and depreciation of all the Pepins.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>
<p>I am better, and I hope on the way to complete recovery,

Perhaps if the winds would give one some rest from
their tormenting importunity, both you and I should
get on faster.</p>

has rejoiced my heart about the "Study of Psychology."
He says: "In this branch of Mr. Lewes's
studies I am almost as one of the ignorant, but I think
I have understood every sentence in the book, and I
believe I have gained great knowledge from it. It
has been the most satisfactory piece of work I have

<p>The sight of your handwriting on the pamphlet sent

done but for a rather sharp illness, which has
kept me chiefly in bed for nearly a fortnight, and from

<p>I enclose a copy of Michael Foster's draft of
conditions for the studentship, which I put into the

it would interest you to see the draft, and I have

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John
Blackwood,
16th

<p>I was beginning to want some news of you, and was
almost ready to ask for it. It is the more welcome
for having had time to ripen into a decidedly good report
of your condition. About myself I have a very
poor story to tell, being now in the fifth week of a
troublesome illness, in which, like you, I have been
partly fed on "poisonous decoctions." To-day, however,
happens to show a considerable improvement in
my symptoms, and I have been walking in the warmer
air with more ease than hitherto. Driving I have not
been able to manage for some time, the motion of the
carriage shaking me too much. The best of care has
been taken of me. I have an excellent country doctor
(Mr. Parsons of Godalming) who watches me daily;
and Sir James Paget and Dr. Andrew Clark have been
down to add their supervision. I begin to think that
if I can avoid any evil condition, such as a chill that
would bring on a relapse, I may soon be pretty well
again. The point to be achieved is to stop the wasting
of my not too solid flesh.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear that the third edition of "Theophrastus"
has had so lively a movement. If the remainder
should be sold off I think it would be well
just to print a small number of copies to carry on,
and avoid bringing out a cheaper edition too soon
after people have been paying for the expensive one.

<p>I have been always able to write my letters and read
my proofs, usually in bed before the fatigue of dressing,
but the rest of my time has been very unprofitable&mdash;spent
chiefly in pain and languor. I am feeling easy
now, and you will well understand that after undergoing
pain this ease is opening paradise. Invalids must

<p>I feel a perhaps too selfish need to tell you that

Why do I want to let you know this not agreeable

be quite clear that if I do not write to say, "When can
you come to me?" it is not from indifference, but from
misfortune of another sort. Meanwhile it will do me
good to have little items of news from you, when you
can find half an hour for the kind deed of writing me

about others, and your letters are just of the sort I

<p>You will understand all the better how much comfort
it is to me to have your help as well as Professor
Foster's, when I tell you that for the last eight weeks
I have been seriously out of health, and have often

<p>It cheers me to be told by you that you think the

<p>Thank you for your sweet affection. I have had
rather a trying illness, which lasted, without great relief,
for nearly eight weeks. But I hope that I am now
out of it&mdash;that is, so far established that I may go on
without a relapse. The cold weather was against me,
as it was and is against much more important matters.
The days of warmth and sunlight which have now and
then blessed us have been my best medicine, though
I acknowledge the benefit of pepsin and steel, and
many other drugs. The gray skies and recurring rain
are peculiarly dispiriting to me, and one seems to feel
their influence all the more for the wide, beautiful view
of field and hill which they sadden and half conceal.
In town one thinks less of the sky.</p>

<p>I am much obliged to you for writing me your letter

<p>It is wonderful how "Theophrastus" goes on selling
in these bad times, and I have only to hope in addition
that the buyers will be the better for it. Apparently
we shall get through this last edition before
Christmas, and then perhaps you will think of adding
the volume to the Cabinet Edition. I am especially
rejoiced to hear that your uncle is better again, and I
trust that Strathtyrum is sharing our sunshine, which
will be the best cure for him as for me. I am getting
strong, and also am gaining flesh on my moderate
scale. It really makes a difference to one's spirits to
think that the harvest may now possibly be got in without
utter ruin to the produce and unhappy producers.
But this year will certainly prove a serious epoch, and
initiate many changes in relation to farming. I fear,
from what I have read, that the rich Lothians will have
to be called compassionately the poor Lothians. By
the way, if you happen to want any translation done
from the French, and have not just the right person
to do it, I think I can recommend a Miss Bradley Jenkins,
of 50 Cornwall Road, Wesbourne Park, as one
who has an unusually competent knowledge of French.
We sat side by side on the same form translating Miss
Edgeworth into French when we were girls.</p>

she has been engaged in a high order of teaching, and
I have lately heard from her that she is anxious to get

<p>Before I received your letter the other day I was intending
to write to you to ask whether, now that I am
stronger and the fine weather shows some signs of permanence,
you feel any revival of the inclination to
come and see me for a couple of days. I hardly like
to propose your taking the journey, now that you are
not being brought near me by other visits&mdash;for the railway
from you to us is, I think, rather tiresome. But
if your inclination really lies towards coming you will
be affectionately welcomed.</p>

<p>About the sea-side I am hopeless. The latter part
of October is likely to be too cold for me to move
about without risk of chills; and I hope to be back in
town before the end of the month. I am not very
fond of the sea-side, and this year it is likely to be
crowded with people who have been hindered by the
bad weather from going earlier. I prefer the Surrey
hills and the security from draughts in one's own
home. The one attraction of a coast place to me is
a great breadth of sand to pace on when it is in its
fresh firmness after the fall of the tide. But the sea
itself is melancholy to me, only a little less so under
warm sunlight, with plenty of fishing-smacks changing
their shadows. All this is to let you know why I do
not yield to the attraction of being with you, where we
could chat as much or as little as we liked. I feel
very much your affectionateness in wishing to have me
near you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

as far as this for my sake.</p>

that your husband is well again, and again happy in

<p>I have had a delightful bit of news from Dr. Foster
this morning. He had mentioned to me before that
there was an Edinburgh student whom he had in his
mind as the right one to elect. This morning he
writes: "The trustees meet to-morrow to receive my
nomination. I have chosen Dr. Charles Roy, an
Edinburgh man, and Scotchman&mdash;not one of my own
pupils. He is, I think, the most promising&mdash;by far
the most promising&mdash;of our young physiologists, putting
aside those who do not need the pecuniary assistance
of the studentship. And the help comes to him
just when it is most needed&mdash;he is in full swing of
work, and was casting about for some means of supporting
himself which would least interfere with his
work, when I called his attention to the studentship.
I feel myself very gratified that I can, at the very outset,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
recommend just the man, as it appears to me, for
the post."</p>

<p>I have just had some news that grieves me. Mr.
Blackwood is dangerously ill, and I fear, from Mr.
William's letter, that there is little hope of recovery.
He will be a heavy loss to me. He has been bound
up with what I most cared for in my life for more than
twenty years; and his good qualities have made many

been difficult.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Your affectionate note would quite have determined
me to do what, when your brother kindly proposed
it, raised a certain longing in me. I thought that I
should like to see you all in the remembered home
again. But I have had a little check in health, and I
am feeling so depressed that I shrink from making
any engagement which involves others.</p>

<p>A visitor to-day and my own languor threatens to
throw me backward in my arrangements for leaving,

that, under other conditions, would be a pleasure. I
am afraid lest a fit of sadness should make me an oppression
to you all; and my conclusion this morning
is that I must give up the few hours' happiness of feeling
your family love around me as I used to do, and
simply go straight up to town with my servants.</p>

<p>But if Friday morning brings me better hopes I will
telegraph to you, since you allow me to wait till the
eleventh hour. If you receive no telegram you will
understand that I am still too downhearted to venture
on a visit even to those who are among the best-loved
of my friends. In that case you must all make me
amends for my loss by coming to see me in the old
place in town.</p>

News about you all had been much desired by me;

I am apt to defer such as are not absolutely necessary.
The careful index is a sign of your effective industry,
and I have no doubt that it will be a great help to
yourself as well as to your readers. One very often
needs an index to one's own writing. My chief objects
are quite completed now. The Dr. Roy appointed
to the studentship is held by competent persons
to be the most hopeful of our young physiologists:
and there is a volume of 501 pages (the last)
of "Problems of Life and Mind" ready to appear
next month. I am quite recovered from the ailment

the want of close companionship continued to be
very bitterly felt. She was in the habit of going
with me very frequently to the National Gallery,
and to other exhibitions of pictures, to the British
Museum sculptures, and to South Kensington.
This constant association engrossed me completely,
and was a new interest to her. A bond of mutual
dependence had been formed between us. On the
28th March she came down to Weybridge and
stayed till the 30th; and on the 9th April it was

<p>The beautiful photograph has reached me safely, and
I am very grateful to you for your kindness in sending
it to me. In comparing it with the photograph
which you gave me seven or eight years ago I see the
effect of a saddening experience which the years must
bring to us all, but, to my feeling, the face is the more
endearing because of that effect.</p>

<p>You have been very often in my thoughts, because I
have associated you with public affairs, and have imagined
sympathetically how they must have affected
your private life. I am sure that this momentous experience
in India has been a hard discipline both for
you and for Lord Lytton. I can imagine he has often
been sick at heart with the near vision, which his post
forces on him, of human meanness and rancor. You,
too, must have gathered some melancholy knowledge
of that sort, which has perhaps changed a little the
curves of the mouth and the glance of the eyes since
those Vienna days, when the delightful M. de Villers
helped to make the hours pleasant to us.</p>

<p>Your letter was a sweet greeting to us on our arrival
here yesterday.</p>

<p>We had a millennial cabin on the deck of the Calais-Douvres,
and floated over the strait as easily as the
saints float upward to heaven (in the pictures). At
Amiens we were very comfortably housed, and paid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
two enraptured visits, evening and morning, to the
cathedral. I was delighted with J.'s delight in it.
And we read our dear old cantos of the "Inferno"
that we were reading a year ago, declining afterwards
on "Eugénie Grandet." The nice woman who waited
on us made herself very memorable to me by her
sketch of her own life. She went to England when
she was nineteen as a lady's maid&mdash;had been much
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennuyée de sa mère</i>, detested <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les plaisirs</i>, liked only her
regular every-day work and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la paix</i>.</p>

<p>Here we have a very fair <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">appartement</i>, and plenty of
sunlight, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au premier</i>. Before dinner we walked up to
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arc de l'Étoile</span> and back again, enjoying the lovely
greenth and blossoms of the horse-chestnuts, which
are in their first glory, innocent of dust or of one withered
petal. This morning at twelve o'clock we are
going to the Russian church, where J. has never been,
and where I hope we shall hear the wonderful intoning
and singing as I heard it years ago.</p>

<p>This is the chronicle of our happy married life, three
days long&mdash;all its happiness conscious of a dear background
in those who are loving us at Weybridge, at
Thornhill, and at Ranby.</p>

<p>You are all inwoven into the pattern of my thoughts,
which would have a sad lack without you. I like to
go over again in imagination all the scene in the
church and in the vestry, and to feel every loving look
from the eyes of those who were rejoicing for us. Besides
Professor Sellar's letter, which touched J. with
grateful surprise, we have had one to him from Mr.
Frederic Harrison, saying everything affectionate, and
two very finely felt letters from Edith Simcox&mdash;one to
him enclosing the one to me. Certainly, she has a
rare generosity and elevation which find their easy

<p>I think I must thank Florence, too, for her letter to
J.; for we accept to the full the principle of "what is
mine is thine" on each side. What most comforted
him this morning was a letter from Albert Druce about
the Chelsea house. His usual exclamation over anything
from Albert is that his brother-in-law is the most
satisfactory of men!</p>

<p>Write us word about everything, and consider yourselves
all very much loved and spiritually petted by
your loving sister.</p>

<p>This place is so magnificently situated, in a smiling
valley, with the Isère flowing through it, and surrounded
by grand and various lines of mountains, and we
were so enraptured by our expedition yesterday to the
Grande Chartreuse that we congratulate ourselves
greatly on our choice of route. I think it unlikely
that we shall want to wander beyond the second week
in July. We shall begin to long for home just when
the rest of the London world are longing for travel.
We are seeing nature in her happiest moment now&mdash;the
foliage on all the tremendous heights, the soft
slopes, and the richly clad valleys on the way to the
Chartreuse is all fresh and tender, shone through by a
sunlight which cherishes and does not burn us. I had
but one regret in seeing the sublime beauty of the
Grande Chartreuse. It was that the Pater had not seen
it. I would still give up my own life willingly if he
could have the happiness instead of me. But marriage
has seemed to restore me to my old self. I was getting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
hard, and if I had decided differently, I think I should
have become very selfish. To feel daily the loveliness
of a nature close to me, and to feel grateful for it, is the
fountain of tenderness and strength to endure.</p>

<p>Glorious weather always, and I am very well&mdash;quite
amazingly able to go through fatigue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter

<p>Our life since we wrote to you has been a chapter
of delights&mdash;Grenoble&mdash;Grande Chartreuse&mdash;Chambéry&mdash;paradisiacal
walk to Les Charmettes&mdash;roses
gathered in Jean Jacques' garden&mdash;Mont Cenis Tunnel
and emergence into Italian sunshine. Milan, comfortable
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">appartement</i>, delicious privacy, and great minds
condescending to relax themselves! We got here yesterday,
and of course our first walk was to the post,
where we found your delightful budget and other letters,
which we took to a <i>café</i> in the grand <i>galleria</i> and
read at our ease to the accompaniment of tea.</p>

<p>Two of my letters yesterday touched me very gratefully.
One was from "Brother Jimmy"&mdash;the prettiest
letter possible. The other letter that moved me was
one from my own brother. Then J. had a graceful
letter of congratulation from Mr. Henry James, who is
still at Florence. I think you did not send that letter
of Mr. Edmund Gurney's which you mention. I am
fond of seeing the letters which put my friends in an
amiable light for my imagination. And now that I
have had that charming letter from my new brother in
America, I feel that my family initiation is complete.
No woman was ever more sweetly received by brothers
and sisters than I have been; and it is a happy, new
longing in my life that I may return into their bosoms
some of the gladness they have poured into mine.</p>

<p>I have been uninterruptedly well, and feel quite
strong with all sorts of strength except strong-mindedness.

We are going to hear the music in the Duomo
at eleven, and after that we intend to pay our first visit
to the Brera gallery. It is our present plan to stay here
for some days, and we enjoy the thought of a little stationary
life such as we have not had since we left Paris.
We often talk of our sisters, oftener think of them.
You are our children, you know.</p>

<p>Your letter was forwarded to me here, and it was a
great joy to me to have your kind words of sympathy,
for our long silence has never broken the affection for
you which began when we were little ones. My husband,
too, was much pleased to read your letter. I
have known his family for eleven years, and they
have received me among them very lovingly. The
only point to be regretted in our marriage is that I
am much older than he; but his affection has made him
choose this lot of caring for me rather than any other
of the various lots open to him.</p>

<p>Emily Clarke has lately sent me rather a sad account
of Sarah's<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
health. I trust that it is now better,
for I think it is her lungs that chiefly trouble her, and
summer may act beneficently on them. Please give
my love to her, and tell her that I like the assurance
of her share in the good wishes you send me.</p>

<p>I have often heard of
Frederick<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>

of those who have heard him preach; and it
has been a happy thought to me that you and Sarah

Walter settled near you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>Many thanks for your delightful letter, which came
to me yesterday, with a loving though brief letter from
Mrs. Congreve to keep it company in making the day
agreeable.</p>

<p>We arrived here on Monday, and have been induced
by a nice quiet apartment and pleasant attendance to
carry out our plan of resting here and deliberately seeing
what is to be seen in this cheerful, prosperous city.
I am glad to find that the Luini pictures come up to
my remembrance, and that J. is much impressed by
his introduction to them. I continue remarkably well,
and am every day surprising myself by the amount of
walking, standing, and looking that I can go through.
To-morrow or the next day we intend to go on to
Verona, then, after a sufficient pause to enjoy that
glorious place, we shall move on to Padua and Venice,
where it will be best for you to send anything you may
have to send. I like to see the letters. They make
one realize the fact of one's home and little world
there amid the dreaminess of foreign travel. We take
our meals in our own apartment and see nothing of
our fellow-guests in the hotel&mdash;only hear their British
and American voices when they air themselves in the
<i>cortile</i> after their dinner.</p>

<p>The weather has hitherto been delicious, not excessively
warm, always with a pleasant movement in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
the air; but this morning there is a decided advance
in heat, and we shall both have our theory of great
heat being the best thing for us well tested in the
next month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Madame
Bodichon,
29th May
and 1st
June, 1880,
from Verona.</div>

<p>The change I make in the date of this letter is a
sign of the difficulty you well know that one finds in
writing all the letters one wants to write while travelling.
Ever since Charles forwarded to me your dear
letter while I was in Paris I have been meaning to
write to you. That letter was doubly sweet to me because
it was written before you received mine, <em>intended</em>
to inform you of my marriage before it appeared in the
newspapers. Charles says that my friends are chiefly
hurt because I did not tell them of the approaching
change in my life. But I really did not finally, absolutely,
decide&mdash;I was in a state of doubt and struggle&mdash;until
only a fortnight before the event took place, so
that at last everything was done in the utmost haste.
However, there were four or five friends, of whom you
were one, to whom I was resolved to write, so that
they should at least get my letter on the morning of
the 6th.</p>

<p>I had more than once said to Mr. Cross that you
were that one of my friends who required the least explanation
on the subject&mdash;who would spontaneously
understand our marriage. But Charles sends me word
that my friends in general are very sympathetic, and I
should like to mention to you that
Bessie<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
is one whose
very kind words he has sent to me, for you may have
an opportunity of giving my love to her, and telling her
that it is very sweet to me to feel that her affection is
constant to me in this as it was in other crises of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
life. I wish, since you can no longer come in and out
among us as you used to do, that you already knew
my husband better. His family welcome me with the
uttermost tenderness. All this is wonderful blessing
falling to me beyond my share, after I had thought
that my life was ended, and that, so to speak, my coffin
was ready for me in the next room. Deep down below
there is a hidden river of sadness, but this must
always be with those who have lived long&mdash;and I am
able to enjoy my newly reopened life. I shall be a
better, more loving creature than I could have been in
solitude. To be constantly, lovingly grateful for the
gift of a perfect love is the best illumination of one's
mind to all the possible good there may be in store for
man on this troublous little planet.</p>

<p>We leave Verona to-day, and stay a little at Padua
on our way to Venice. Hitherto we have had delightful
weather, and just the temperature we rejoice
in. We are both fond of warmth, and could bear more
heat than we have the prospect of at present.</p>

<p>Yesterday we had a drive on the skirting heights of
Verona, and saw the vast fertile plain around, with the
Euganean hills, blue in the distance, and the Apennines
just dimly visible on the clear margin of the
horizon. I am always made happier by seeing well-cultivated
land.</p>

<p>We came into Italy by way of Grenoble (seeing the
Grande Chartreuse), Chambéry, and the Mont Cenis
Tunnel; since then we have been staying at Milan and
enjoying the Luini frescoes and a few other great things
there. The great things are always by comparison
few, and there is much everywhere one would like to
help seeing, after it has once served to give one a notion
of historical progression.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>We shall stay at Venice for ten days or a fortnight;
so if you have a scribe, or would write yourself, to tell
me that all is going on well with you, the letter would
not, as the Scotch say, "go amissing."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Charles L.
Lewes, 9th
June, 1880,
from
Venice.</div>

<p>We both enjoyed reading your letter on the morning
after our arrival at this enchanting city, where the
glorious light, with comparative stillness and total
absence of dust, makes a paradise much more desirable
than that painted by Tintoretto on the wall of the
Consiglio Maggiore. Nothing but the advent of mosquitoes
would make it easy for us to tear ourselves
away from this place, where every prospect pleases, but
also where one is obliged to admit that man is somewhat
vile. I am sadly disappointed in the aspect of
the Venetian populace. Even physically they look
less endowed than I thought them when we were here
under the Austrian dominion. We have hardly seen
a sweet or noble woman's face since we arrived; but
the men are not quite so ill-looking as the women.
The singing here (by itinerant performers in gondolas)
is disgraceful to Venice and to Italy. Coarse voices,
much out of tune, make one shudder when they strike
suddenly under the window.</p>

<p>Our days here are passed quite deliciously. We see
a few beautiful pictures or other objects of interest,
and dwell on them sufficiently every morning, not
hurrying ourselves to do much; and afterwards we
have a <i>giro</i> in our gondola, enjoying the air and the
sight of marvellous Venice from various points of view
and under various aspects. Hitherto we have had no
<em>heat</em>, only warmth, with a light breeze. To-day, for the
first time, one thinks that violent exercise must be
terribly trying for our red-skinned fellow-mortals at
work on the gondolas and the barges. But for us it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
is only pleasant to find the air warm enough for sitting
out in the evening. We shall not soon run away
from Venice unless some plague&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, mosquitoes&mdash;should
arise to drive us. We edify ourselves with
what Ruskin has written about Venice, in an agreeable
pamphlet shape, using his knowledge gratefully, and
shutting our ears to his wrathful innuendoes against
the whole modern world. And we are now nearly at
the end of Alfieri's autobiography, which is a deeply
interesting study of character.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Congreve,
10th
June, 1880.</div>

<p>It may well seem incredible to you, for it is hardly
credible to myself, that while I have been longing to
write to you ever since I received your dear letter, I
have not found the time to satisfy my longing. Perhaps
you are more able than most people to conceive
the difficulty of getting a clear half-hour between the
business of travelling and the attention to little details
of packing and toilet, over and above the companionship
of talk and reading. Certainly I have thought of
you all the more, but you have not known that, and I
have lost my claim to hear about you&mdash;a use and wont
which I would not willingly part with.</p>

<p>I wonder whether you have imagined&mdash;I believe
that you are quick to imagine for the benefit of others&mdash;all
the reasons why it was left at last to Charles to
tell you of the great, once undreamed-of change in my
life. The momentous decision, in fact, was not made
till scarcely more than a fortnight before my marriage;
and even if opportunity had lent itself to my confiding
everything to you, I think I could hardly have done it
at a time when your presence filled me rather with a
sense of your and Emily's
trouble<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
than with my own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
affairs. Perhaps Charles will have told you that the
marriage deprives no one of any good I felt bound to
render before&mdash;it only gives me a more strenuous position,
in which I cannot sink into the self-absorption
and laziness I was in danger of before. The whole
history is something like a miracle-legend. But instead
of any former affection being displaced in my
mind, I seem to have recovered the loving sympathy
that I was in danger of losing. I mean, that I had
been conscious of a certain drying-up of tenderness in
me, and that now the spring seems to have risen again.
Who could take your place within me or make me
amends for the loss of you? And yet I should not take
it bitterly if you felt some alienation from me. Such
alienation is very natural where a friend does not fulfil
expectations of long standing.</p>

<p>We have already been ten days at Venice, but we
hope to remain as long again, not fearing the heat,
which has hitherto been only a false alarm in the
minds of English travellers. If you could find time to
send me word how you all are&mdash;yourself, Dr. Congreve
after his holiday, and Emily, with all her cares about
removal&mdash;a letter sent to the <i>Poste Restante</i> here
would reach me, even if we had left before the next
ten days were over. We shall hardly be at Witley before
the middle of July: but the sense of neighborhood
to you at Witley is sadly ended now.</p>

<blockquote><p>We thought too little of the heat, and rather
laughed at English people's dread of the sun. But
the mode of life at Venice has its peculiar dangers.
It is one thing to enjoy heat when leading an active
life, getting plenty of exercise in riding or rowing
in the evenings; it is another thing to spend all
one's days in a gondola&mdash;a delicious, dreamy existence&mdash;going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
from one church to another&mdash;from
palaces to picture-galleries&mdash;sight-seeing of the
most exhaustively interesting kind&mdash;traversing constantly
the <i>piccoli rei</i>, which are nothing more than
drains, and with bedroom-windows always open on
the great drain of the Grand Canal. The effect
of this continual bad air, and the complete and
sudden deprivation of all bodily exercise, made me
thoroughly ill. As soon as I could be moved we
left Venice, on the 23d of June, and went to Innspruck,
where we stayed for a week, and in the
change to the pure, sweet, mountain air I soon regained
strength.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Charles L.
Lewes, 7th
July, 1880,
from Stuttgart.</div>

<p>I was made very glad by Gertrude's letter, which assured
me that Witley had been enjoyed by you and
the little ones. We stayed six days at Innspruck, finding
it more and more beautiful under the sunshine
which had been wanting to it during our first two days.
Then we went on to Munich, and yesterday we arrived
here, as a temporary resting-place on our way to Wildbad,
which, we hope, will put the finishing-touch to J.'s
recovery of his usual health.</p>

<p>I wish I had been able to let you know in time that
you could have remained a little longer at Witley, as I
think we shall hardly be at home before the 20th if we
find Wildbad what we want. Your <i>Mutter</i> is marvellously
well and strong. It seems more natural to her
to have anxiety than to be free from it. Let us hope
that she will not run down like a jelly-fish now that
her anxiety is over.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Charles L.
Lewes,
13th July,
1880, from
Wildbad.</div>

<p>I received your welcome letter yesterday morning,
and felt inclined to answer it the next minute. J. is
quite well again, but is inclined to linger a little in the
sweet air of the Schwarzwald, which comes to one on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
gently stirred wings, laden with the scent of the pine
forests. We mean to drive from here to Baden, which
is within easy distance.</p>

<p>Yesterday we sallied forth for a walk over the mountain,
to a place where we could rest and lunch, returning
in the afternoon. The sky was brilliant. But in
half an hour the clouds gathered and threatened a
storm. We were prudent enough to turn back, and by
the time we were in the hotel again the thunder was
rolling and the rain pouring down. This continued
till about two o'clock, and then again the sky became
clear. I never saw so incalculable a state of weather
as we have in this valley. One quarter of an hour the
blue sky is only flecked by lightest cirrus clouds, the
next it is almost hidden by dark rain clouds. But we
are going to start on our promised expedition this
morning, the sunshine flattering us that it is quite confirmed.</p>

<p>I think you had better address your next letter <i>Poste
Restante</i>, Strasburg, as I am uncertain how long we
shall rest at Baden.</p>

<blockquote><p>Left Wildbad on the 17th July, and had a delightful
drive through the Black Forest by Herrenalb
to Baden, and thence by Strasburg, Metz, Luxemburg,
and Brussels, arriving at Witley on Monday

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>We arrived here in all safety last Monday, and if I had
not had your welcome little note this morning I think
I should soon have written to you without any such
extra stimulus.</p>

<p>Mr. Cross had a sharp but brief attack at Venice,
due to the unsanitary influences of that wondrous city
in the later weeks of June. We stayed a little too
long there, with a continuous sirocco blowing, and bad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
smells under the windows of the hotel; and these conditions
found him a little below par from long protracted
anxiety before our marriage. But ever since
we left Venice (on the 23d of June) he has been getting
strong again, and we have enjoyed a leisurely
journey through Germany in constant warmth and
sunshine, save for an occasional thunderstorm. The
climate in this beloved country of ours is a sad exchange,
and makes one think of a second bad harvest,
with all its consequences. Still, it is a delight to be at
home and enjoy perfect stillness, after the noisiness of
foreign bells and foreign voices indoors and out. It
would be very pretty to pay you a visit next April, if
we are all alive, and I think Mr. Cross would like it
very much. He sends you, hoping you will accept
them, his best remembrances, which have been kept up
by our often talking about you. I have been amazingly
well through all the exertion of our travels, and in the
latter half of the time have done a great deal of walking.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Peter
Taylor, 2d
Aug. 1880.</div>

<p>How sweet of you to write me a little welcome as
soon as you knew that I was at home again.</p>

<p>Yes, we are both well now, and <em>glad</em> to be at home
again, though the change of climate is not of the exhilarating
sort. One is so sorry for all the holiday-makers,
whose best enjoyment of these three days
would have been in the clear air and sunshine.</p>

<p>Do not reproach me for not telling you of my marriage
beforehand. It is difficult to speak of what surprises
ourselves, and the decision was sudden, though
not the friendship which led to the decision.</p>

<p>My heart thoroughly responds to your remembrance
of our long&mdash;our thirty-years' relation to each other.
Let me tell you this once what I have said to others&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
I value you as one of the purest-minded, gentlest-hearted
women I have ever known, and where such a
feeling exists, friendship can live without much aid
from sight.</p>

<p>We shall probably not be in town again till the beginning
of November. Our address then will be 4
Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, where we shall have an outlook
on the river and meadows beyond. Just now
we have the prospect of going on family visits to married
sisters, which prevents us from feeling quite settled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Charles L.

12th Aug.
1880.</div>

<p>I expected your letter, and expected, too, just the
sort of letter I have received, telling me everything delightfully.
I can follow you everywhere in your journeying
except to Ober Wesel. I hope you will have
enjoyed St. Blasien and some of the walks there consecrated
by the beloved Pater's footsteps. We reversed
your drive and went to Freiburg, so that I can
enter into your enjoyment of the Höllenthal. I am
glad that your weather has been temperate. Here we
have now had four sunny and really hot days, and this
morning promises to be the fifth. That is consolatory
as to the harvest, and is very agreeable as to our private
life. The last two evenings we have walked in
the garden after eight o'clock&mdash;the first time by starlight,
the second under a vapory sky, with the red
moon setting. The air was perfectly still and warm,
and I felt no need of extra clothing.</p>

<p>Our life has had no more important events than calls
from neighbors and our calls in return. To-morrow
we pay our visit to the Druces at Sevenoaks, where,
you may remember, Mr. Druce has built a beautiful
house. At the beginning of September we are to visit
Mr. and Mrs. Otter at Ranby, and after that we shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
go to Six-Mile Bottom for a day or two. Then our
wanderings will be over.</p>

<p>I went to the Priory the other day, and found a
treatise on Blood Pressure, by Dr. Roy, which he had
sent me there, and which he has published as the
"George Henry Lewes Student." I imagine that he
has come to pursue his studies in England, as he intended
to do. Delbeuf's article on the last volume of
the "Problems" (in the Belgian <cite>Athenæum</cite>) is very
nicely done. He has read the book.</p>

<p>I am pretty well, but find myself more languid than
I was when abroad. I think the cause is perhaps the
moisture of the climate. There is something languorous
in this climate, or, rather, in its effects. J. gets a little
better every day, and so each day is more enjoyable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to Mrs.
Burne-Jones,
9th
Sept. 1880.</div>

<p>We have just come home after paying family visits
in Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire, else I should
have answered your letter earlier. The former one
reached me in Venice, when I was in great trouble on
account of Mr. Cross's illness. I had had reason to
believe that my letters, ordered to be posted on the
5th of May, had not been delivered; so I asked
Charles to inquire about the letter I wrote to you&mdash;not
because it demanded an answer, but because I wished
you to know that I had written.</p>

<p>I am so glad to know that you have been enjoying
our brief English summer. The good harvest makes
the country everywhere cheerful, and we have been in
great, even districts where the fields, full of sheaves or
studded with ricks, stretch wide as a prairie. Now,
we hope not to leave this place again till November,
when we intend to go to Chelsea for the winter and
earliest spring.</p>

<p>I almost envy you the opportunity of seeing Wombwell's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Menagerie. I suppose I got more delight out
of that itinerant institution when I was nine or ten
years old than I have ever got out of the Zoological
Gardens. The smells and the sawdust mingled themselves
with my rapture. Everything was good.</p>

finished your holiday. My love attends you all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

Bodichon,
14th Sept.

<p>Your letter this morning is a welcome assurance
about you. We have been away in Lincolnshire and
Cambridgeshire, paying visits to the Otters and the
Halls. The weather, which is now broken, was glorious
through all our wandering, which we made very
interesting by pausing to see Ely, Peterborough, and
Lincoln cathedrals. The Otters have a very pretty,
happy household. He is a country gentleman now,
acting as a magistrate, and glancing towards Parliament.
But he keeps up his reading, and is delightful
to talk to. Emily looks very pretty in her matronly
position, with three little children. The Halls, too,
are very pleasant to behold in their home life. He
has done wonders in building nice cottages and
schools, and sinking wells where they were wanted,
and founding a co-operative store&mdash;and, in general,
doing whatever opportunity allows towards slowly improving
this confused world. We saw (at Six-Mile
Bottom) Mr. and Mrs. Sidgwick. Perhaps you know
that they have had, and have, the admirable public
spirit to let their house and arrange to live for a year
in the new Newnham House, in order to facilitate matters
for the double institution.</p>

<p>We are very well. Mr. Cross gets stronger and
brighter every day. We often mention you, because
you are associated with so many of my memories.</p>

<p>Our only bugbear&mdash;it is a very little one&mdash;is the having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
to make preliminary arrangements towards settling
ourselves in the new house (4 Cheyne Walk). It is a
quaint house; and a Mr. Armitage of Manchester, of
whom you may have heard, has been superintending
the decoration and furnishing, but not to the exclusion
of old things, which we must carry and stow, especially
wallings of books. I am become so lazy that I shrink
from all such practical work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Charles L.
Lewes, 23d
Sept. 1880.</div>

<p>I have been and am suffering under an attack of a
comparatively mild sort, but I expect to be well in two
or three days, and am just going to drive to Godalming
to meet my husband. Hence I write this hurriedly.
We should like to see you and Gertrude from Saturday
to Monday some week next month if it would be pleasant
to you.</p>

<blockquote><p>This attack was a recurrence of the renal disorder
of the previous year. On the 29th September
we went for ten days to Brighton as the most accessible
place for a bracing change. The first effects
of the sea breezes were encouraging, but the
improvement was not maintained. Shortly after
our return to Witley Dr. Andrew
Clark,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
"the beloved
physician," came down to consult with Mr.
Parsons of Godalming&mdash;on 22d October. From
that time there was gradual but slow improvement,
and, during November, a decided recovery of
strength. But an English autumn was not favorable
to the invalid. Her sensibility to climatic influences
was extreme. It will have been noticed
in the preceding letters how constantly change of
air and scene was required. I had never seen my
wife out of England, previous to our marriage, except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the first time at Rome, when she was suffering.
My general impression, therefore, had been that her
health was always very low, and that she was almost
constantly ailing. Moreover, I had been with her
very frequently during her long, severe illness at
Witley in 1879. I was the more surprised, after
our marriage, to find that from the day she set her
foot on Continental soil till the day she returned
to Witley she was never ill&mdash;never even unwell.
She began at once to look many years younger.
During the eleven years of our acquaintance I had
never seen her so strong in health. The greater
dryness and lightness of the atmosphere seemed to
have a magical effect. At Paris we spent our mornings
at the Louvre or the Luxembourg, looking at
pictures or sculpture, or seeing other sights&mdash;always
fatiguing work. In the afternoons we took
long walks in the Bois, and very often went to the
theatre in the evening. Reading and writing filled
in all the interstices of time; yet there was no consciousness
of fatigue. And we had the same experience
at all the places we stayed at in Italy. On
our way home she was able to take a great deal of
walking exercise at Wildbad and Baden. Decrease
of physical strength coincided exactly with the time
of our return to the damper climate of England.
The specific form of illness did not declare itself
until two months later, but her health was never
again the same as it had been on the Continent.
Towards the middle of October she was obliged to
keep her bed, but without restriction as to amount
of reading and talking, which she was always able
to enjoy, except in moments of acute pain.</p>

<p>During her illness I read aloud, among other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
books, Comte's "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Discours Préliminaire</span>," translated
by Dr. Bridges. This volume was one of her
especial favorites, and she delighted in making
me acquainted with it. For all Comte's writing
she had a feeling of high admiration, intense interest,
and very deep sympathy. I do not think I
ever heard her speak of any writer with a more
grateful sense of obligation for enlightenment.
Her great debt to him was always thankfully acknowledged.
But the appreciation was thoroughly
selective, so far as I was able to judge. Parts
of his teaching were accepted and other parts
rejected. Her attitude towards him, as the founder
of a new religion, may be gathered from the references
and allusions in the foregoing correspondence,
and from the fact that for many years, and
up to the time of her death, she subscribed to the
Comtist Fund, but never, so far as I am aware,
more directly associated herself with the members
of the Positivist Church. It was a limited adherence.</p>

<p>We generally began our reading at Witley with
some chapters of the Bible, which was a very precious
and sacred book to her, not only from early
associations, but also from the profound conviction
of its importance in the development of
the religious life of man. She particularly enjoyed
reading aloud some of the finest chapters
of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and St. Paul's Epistles. With
a naturally rich, deep voice, rendered completely
flexible by constant practice; with the keenest
perception of the requirements of emphasis, and with
the most subtile modulations of tone, her reading
threw a glamour over indifferent writing, and gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
to the greatest writing fresh meanings and beauty.
The Bible and our elder English poets best suited
the organ-like tones of her voice, which required,
for their full effect, a certain solemnity and majesty
of rhythm. Her reading of Milton was especially
fine; and I shall never forget four great lines
of the "Samson Agonistes" to which it did perfect
justice&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But what more oft in nations grown corrupt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by their vices brought to servitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than to love bondage more than liberty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bondage with ease than strenuous liberty."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The delighted conviction of justice in the thought&mdash;the
sense of perfect accord between thought, language,
and rhythm&mdash;stimulated the voice of the
reader to find the exactly right tone. Such reading
requires for its perfection a rare union of intellectual,
moral, and physical qualities. It cannot be
imitated. It is an art, like singing&mdash;a personal
possession that dies with the possessor, and leaves
nothing behind except a memory. Immediately
before her illness we had read, together, the first
part of "Faust." Reading the poem in the original
with such an interpreter was the opening of a
new world to me. Nothing in all literature moved
her more than the pathetic situation and the whole
character of Gretchen. It touched her more than
anything in Shakespeare. During the time that we
were reading the "Faust" we were also constantly
reading, together, Shakespeare, Milton, and Wordsworth:
some of Scott's novels and Lamb's essays
too, in which she greatly delighted. For graver
study we read through Professor Sayce's "Introduction
to the Science of Language." Philology
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
was a subject in which she was most deeply interested;
and this was my first experience of what
seemed to me a limitless persistency in application.
I had noticed the persistency before, while looking
at pictures, or while hearing her play difficult music;
for it was characteristic of her nature that she
took just as great pains to play her very best to a
single unlearned listener as most performers would
do to a room full of critical <i>cognoscenti</i>. Professor
Sayce's book was the first which we had read together
requiring very sustained attention ("The
Divina Commedia" we had read in very short bits
at a time), and it revealed to me more clearly the
depth of George Eliot's mental concentration. Continuous
thought did not fatigue her. She could keep
her mind on the stretch hour after hour: the body
might give way, but the brain remained unwearied.</p>

<p>Her memory held securely her great stores of
reading. Even of light books her recollections
were always crisp, definite, and vivid. On our way
home from Venice, after my illness, we were reading
French novels of Cherbuliez, Alphonse Daudet,
Gustave Droz, George Sand. Most of these books
she had read years before, and I was astonished to
find what clear-cut, accurate impressions had been
retained, not only of all the principal characters,
but also of all the subsidiary personages&mdash;even
their names were generally remembered. But, on
the other hand, her verbal memory was not always
to be depended on. She never could trust herself
to write a quotation without verifying it.</p>

<p>In foreign languages George Eliot had an experience
more unusual among women than among
men. With a complete literary and scholarly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
knowledge of French, German, Italian, and Spanish,
she <em>spoke</em> all four languages with difficulty,
though accurately and grammatically; but the
mimetic power of catching intonation and accent
was wanting. Greek and Latin she could read
with thorough delight to herself; and Hebrew was
a favorite study to the end of her life. In her
younger days, especially at Geneva, inspired by
Professor de la Rive's lectures, she had been
greatly interested in mathematical studies. At
one time she applied herself heartily and with
keen enjoyment to geometry, and she thought that
she might have attained to some excellence in that
branch if she had been able to pursue it. In later
days the map of the heavens lay constantly on her
table at Witley, and she longed for deeper astronomical
knowledge. She had a passion for the
stars; and one of the things to which we looked
forward on returning to London was a possible
visit to Greenwich Observatory, as she had never
looked through a great telescope of the first class.
Her knowledge of wild-flowers gave a fresh interest
each day to our walks in the Surrey lanes, as
every hedgerow is full of wonders&mdash;to "those who
know;" but she would, I think, have disclaimed
for herself real botanical knowledge, except of an
elementary sort.</p>

<p>This wide and varied culture was accompanied
with an unaffected distrust of her own knowledge,
with the sense of how little she really knew, compared
with what it was possible for her to have
known, in the world. Her standard was always
abnormally high&mdash;it was the standard of an expert;
and she believed in the aphorism that to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
know any subject well we must know the details
of it.</p>

<p>During our short married life our time was so
much divided between travelling and illness that
George Eliot wrote very little, so that I have but
slight personal experience of how the creative effort
affected her. But she told me that, in all that
she considered her best writing, there was a "not
herself," which took possession of her, and that
she felt her own personality to be merely the instrument
through which this spirit, as it were, was
acting. Particularly she dwelt on this in regard to
the scene in "Middlemarch" between Dorothea
and Rosamond, saying that, although she always
knew they had, sooner or later, to come together,
she kept the idea resolutely out of her mind until
Dorothea was in Rosamond's drawing-room. Then,
abandoning herself to the inspiration of the moment,
she wrote the whole scene exactly as it
stands, without alteration or erasure, in an intense
state of excitement and agitation, feeling herself
entirely possessed by the feelings of the two women.
Of all the characters she had attempted she
found Rosamond's the most difficult to sustain.
With this sense of "possession" it is easy to imagine
what the cost to the author must have been
of writing books, each of which has its tragedy.
We have seen the suffering alluded to in the letters
on the "Mill on the Floss," "Felix Holt," and
"Romola."</p>

<p>For those who would know the length and the
breadth of George Eliot's intellectual capacity she
has written her books. Here I am only putting
down some of my own personal impressions or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
recollections, which must be taken for what they
are worth. In doing this I should like to dwell on
the catholicity of her judgment. Singularly free
from the spirit of detraction, either in respect of
her contemporaries or her predecessors, she was
always anxious to see the best and the most noble
qualities of human beings or of books, in cases
where she felt some general sympathy notwithstanding
particular disagreements. And it was
this wide sympathy, this understanding of so many
points of view, that gained for her the passionate
devotion not only of personal friends, but also of
literary admirers, from the most widely sundered
sections of society. Probably few people have
ever received so many intimate confidences from
confidants of such diverse habits of thought.</p>

<p>This many-sidedness, however, makes it exceedingly
difficult to ascertain, either from her books or
from the closest personal intimacy, what her exact
relation was to any existing religious creed or to
any political party. Yet George Eliot's was emphatically
a religious mind. My own impression
is that her whole soul was so imbued with, and her
imagination was so fired by, the scientific spirit of
the age&mdash;by the constant rapid development of
ideas in the Western world&mdash;that she could not
conceive that there was, as yet, any religious formula
sufficient nor any known political system
likely to be final. She had great hope for the future,
in the improvement of human nature by the
gradual development of the affections and the
sympathetic emotions, and "by the slow, stupendous
teaching of the world's events," rather than
by means of legislative enactments. Party measures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
and party men afforded her no great interest.
Representative government, by numerical majorities,
did not appeal to her as the last word of political
wisdom. Generally speaking, she had little
patience with talk about practical politics, which
seemed to her under our present system to be too
often very unpractically handled by ignorant amateurs.
The amateur was always a "stone of stumbling,
and a rock of offence." Her wrath used
often to be roused, in late years, by the increased
bitterness in the language of parties, and by the
growing habit of attributing, for political effect, the
most shameful motives to distinguished statesmen.</p>

<p>She was keenly anxious to redress injustices to
women, and to raise their general status in the
community. This, she thought, could best be effected
by women improving their work&mdash;ceasing to
be amateurs. But it was one of the most distinctly
marked traits in her character that she particularly
disliked everything generally associated with the
idea of a "masculine woman." She was, and as a
woman she wished to be, above all things, feminine&mdash;"so
delicate with her needle, and an admirable
musician." She was proud, too, of being an excellent
housekeeper&mdash;an excellence attained from
knowing how things ought to be done, from her
early training, and from an inborn habit of extreme
orderliness. Nothing offended her more
than the idea that because a woman had exceptional
intellectual powers therefore it was right
that she should absolve herself, or be absolved,
from her ordinary household duties.</p>

<p>It will have been seen from the letters that
George Eliot was deeply interested in the higher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
education of women, and that she was among the
earliest contributors to Girton College. After meeting
Mr. and Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, in September,
1880, when they had gone to reside at the new
hall of Newnham College for a time, she was anxious
to be associated in that work also, but she
did not live to carry out the plan herself. The
danger she was alive to in the system of collegiate
education was the possible weakening of the bonds
of family affection and family duties. In her view,
the family life holds the roots of all that is best in
our mortal lot; and she always felt that it is far
too ruthlessly sacrificed in the case of English <em>men</em>
by their public school and university education,
and that much more is such a result to be deprecated
in the case of women. But, the absolute
good being unattainable in our mixed condition of
things, those women especially who are obliged to
earn their own living must do their best with the
opportunities at their command, as "they cannot
live with posterity," when a more perfect system
may prevail. Therefore, George Eliot wished God-speed
to the women's colleges. It was often in
her mind and on her lips that the only worthy end
of all learning, of all science, of all life, in fact, is,
that human beings should love one another better.
Culture merely for culture's sake can never be
anything but a sapless root, capable of producing
at best a shrivelled branch.</p>

<p>In her general attitude towards life George Eliot
was neither optimist nor pessimist. She held to
the middle term, which she invented for herself, of
"meliorist." She was cheered by the hope and by
the belief in gradual improvement of the mass; for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
in her view each individual must find the better
part of happiness in helping another. She often
thought it wisest not to raise too ambitious an
ideal, especially for young people, but to impress
on ordinary natures the immense possibilities of
making a small home circle brighter and better.
Few are born to do the great work of the world,
but all are born to this. And to the natures capable
of the larger effort the field of usefulness will
constantly widen.</p>

<p>In her personal bearing George Eliot was seldom
moved by the hurry which mars all dignity in
action. Her commanding brows and deep, penetrating
eyes were seconded by the sweet, restrained,
impressive speech, which claimed something like
an awed attention from strangers. But to those
very near to her there was another side of her nature,
scarcely suspected by outside friends and acquaintances.
No one could be more capable of
enjoying and of communicating genuine, loving,
hearty, uncontrollable laughter. It was a deep-seated
wish, expressed in the poem of "Agatha"&mdash;"I
would have young things merry." And I remember,
many years ago, at the time of our first
acquaintance, how deeply it pained her when, in
reply to a direct question, I was obliged to admit
that, with all my admiration for her books, I found
them, on the whole, profoundly sad. But sadness
was certainly not the note of her intimate converse.
For she had the distinctively feminine qualities
which lend a rhythm to the movement of life. The
quick sympathy that understands without words;
the capacity for creating a complete atmosphere
of loving interest; the detachment from outside influences;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
the delight in everything worthy&mdash;even
the smallest thing&mdash;for its own sake; the readiness
to receive as well as to give impressions; the disciplined
mental habit which can hold in check and
conquer the natural egoism of a massive, powerful
personality; the versatility of mind; the varied accomplishments&mdash;these
are characteristics to be
found more highly developed among gifted women
than among gifted men. Add to these the crowning
gift of genius, and, in such companionship, we
may possess the world without belonging to it.</p>

<p>The November days had come now&mdash;cold and
clear. My wife was able again to enjoy the daily
drives and walks on which she was very dependent
for health. The letters continue.</p></blockquote>

<p>Since I wrote to you I have been much more ill, and
have only, during the last few days, begun to feel myself
recovering strength. But I have been cared for
with something much better than angelic tenderness.
The fine, clear air, if it lasts, will induce us to linger
in the country; and, indeed, I am not yet quite fit to
move; for, though I appear to be quite cured of my
main ailment, half my bodily self has vanished. We
are having deliciously clear days here, and I get out
for short drives and walks. I really have nothing to
complain of now except a little lack of strength. I
play on the piano again, and walk with perfect ease.
There is a long chapter about myself!</p>

<p>Three weeks ago I had a rather troublesome attack,
but I am getting well now, though still reduced and
comparatively weak. We shall probably linger here
till near the end of the month, for the autumnal landscape
is very beautiful, and I am not yet quite fit for
the exertion of moving. It is a comfort to think that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
you can be very snug through the winter in your nice
house. What a pity we are not within an easy driving
distance from you!</p>

<p>Mr. Hall is here to-day. He gave a lecture on Leclaire,
the house-painter in Paris who initiated an excellent
plan of co-operative sharing for his workmen.
It has been printed, and when I have another copy I
will send it you. Leclaire is mentioned by John S.
Mill in the notes to his "Political Economy," but had
not been otherwise taken much notice of. Still, you
may know all about him.</p>

<p>Thanks for your loving remembrance of me. We
have been kept in the country by two sufficient causes:
I have been ill, and the house at Cheyne Walk has
not been ready to receive us. I suppose we shall not
be there till the end of the month instead of the beginning.
One of the good things I look forward to is the
sight of your dear face again. You will see little more
than half of me, for nearly half has been consumed.
But I have been nursed with supreme tenderness, and
am daily gaining some strength. Much love to both.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>We are lingering here for three reasons: the beauty
of the weather, the unreadiness of the house, and my
unfitness to bear the hurry of moving. I am getting
better, but have not yet been able to bear much exertion.</p>

<p>Thanks for your pretty letter. I do not think I shall
have many returns of Novembers, but there is every
prospect that such as remain to me will be as happy
as they can be made by the devoted tenderness which
watches over me. Your years will probably be many,
and it is cheering to me to think that you have many
springs of happiness in your lot that are likely to grow
fuller with advancing time.

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I have thought of you all the more because I have
not even heard anything of you for several months.
You will wonder less why I have not written, as a consequence
of those thoughts, when I tell you that I have
been ill, and not allowed to do anything but indulge
myself and receive indulgence. I am very well now,
and am every day consciously gathering strength, so
that, if I could like giving trouble, I should look back
on my illness as a great opportunity of enjoying the
tenderest watching and nursing. I kept my bed only
about a week, and have always been equal, except at
short intervals, to much reading and talking, so that
there is no fair cause for any grumbling on my part.
It has not been so bad an illness as that of last summer.
You see we are not yet at Cheyne Walk, but we
are to be settled there by the end of next week. I
have had no trouble, but have remained here on my
cushions while Mr. Cross has gone early for several
mornings running to superintend the removal. It is
difficult to give you materials for imagining my "world."
Think of me as surrounded and cherished by family
love; by brothers and sisters whose characters are admirable
to me, and who have for years been my friends.
But there is no excessive visiting among us, and the
life of my own hearth is chiefly that of dual companionship.
If it is any good for me that my life has been
prolonged till now, I believe it is owing to this miraculous
affection which has chosen to watch over me.</p>

<p>Only on Friday evening did we get into this new
house, and I had deferred writing to you till I could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
say "Come and see me." I can say so now, but on
reflection I have come to the conclusion that you would
like yourself to fix a time beforehand, the journey here
being rather long. Perhaps you will like to choose a
day on which you could go to Emily also, her house
being less formidably distant&mdash;across the park and
down Sloane Street would be an easy way to us. This
week we shall be much engaged in household matters,
such as the reduction to order of the chaos which still
reigns in certain places least obvious to visitors, and
the procuring of small objects, either necessary or desirable.
But after this week I shall be most glad if
you and Dr. Congreve will come to see us just <em>as</em> and
<em>when</em> you would find the least inconvenience in doing
so&mdash;either at lunch-time (half-past one) or at a later hour.</p>

<p>I find myself in a new climate here&mdash;the London
air and this particular house being so warm compared
with Witley. I hope that you too find the air mild,
for I know that suits you best.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dr. and Mrs. Congreve paid their promised visit
the week after this letter was written; and Madame
Belloc lunched with us the following day. Order
was beginning to reign in the new house. The
books had all been arranged as nearly as possible
in the same order that they had occupied at the
Priory, Mr. Radermacher of the Pantechnicon having
given his personal attention to this arrangement
of some thousands of volumes, for which
George Eliot was particularly grateful. Notwithstanding
all this care, however, there were many
unforeseen details of furnishing still to be completed,
which caused a considerable expenditure of
time. We continued reading aloud Max Müller's
"Lectures on the Science of Language," and Duffield's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
translation of "Don Quixote;" we were
also reading "Hermann and Dorothea," Tennyson's
last volume of poems, just published, and Mr.
Frederic Myers's volume on Wordsworth. In the
evenings we had always a little feast of music, and
were becoming in every way reconciled to town
life, notwithstanding the loss of country quiet, light,
and beauty. On the afternoon of Friday, the 17th
December, we went to see the "Agamemnon" performed
in Greek by Oxford undergraduates. The
representation was a great enjoyment&mdash;an exciting
stimulus&mdash;and my wife proposed that during the
winter we should read together some of the great
Greek dramas. The following afternoon we went
to the Saturday Popular Concert at St. James's
Hall. It was a cold day. The air in the hall was
overheated, and George Eliot allowed a fur cloak
which she wore to slip from her shoulders. I was
conscious of a draught, and was afraid of it for her,
as she was very sensitive to cold. I begged her
to resume the cloak, but, smiling, she whispered
that the room was really too hot. In the evening
she played through several of the pieces that we
had heard at the concert, with all her accustomed
enjoyment of the piano, and with a touch as true
and as delicate as ever. On Sunday there was
very slight trouble in the throat, but not sufficient
to prevent her from coming down-stairs to breakfast
as usual. In the afternoon she was well enough
to receive visits from Mr. Herbert Spencer and one
or two other friends. Afterwards she began the following
letter to Mrs. Strachey. It was left unfinished
in her writing-case, and is printed as it stands.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to Mrs.
Strachey,
19th Dec.
1880.</div>

<p>I have been thinking so much of Lady Colvile, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
yet I shrank from troubling even your more indirect
sympathetic sorrow with a letter. I am wondering
how far her health is in a state to endure this loss&mdash;a
loss which extends even to me, who only occasionally
saw, but was always cheered by, the expression
of a wise and sweet nature, which clearly shone in Sir
James Colvile's manner and conversation. One great
comfort I believe she has&mdash;that of a sister's affection.</p>

<blockquote><p>Here the letter is broken off. The pen which
had delighted and comforted so many minds and
hearts here made its last mark. The spring, which
had broadened out into so wide a river of speech,
ceased to flow.</p>

<p>Little more remains to be told. On Monday the
doctor treated the case as one of laryngeal sore
throat; and when Dr. Andrew Clark came for consultation
on Wednesday evening the pericardium
was found to be seriously affected. While the doctors
were at her bedside she had just time to whisper
to me, "Tell them I have great pain in the left
side," before she became unconscious. Her long
illness in the autumn had left her no power to rally.
She passed away, about ten o'clock at night, on the
22d December, 1880.</p>

<p>She died, as she would herself have chosen to
die, without protracted pain, and with every faculty
brightly vigorous.</p>

<p>Her body rests in Highgate Cemetery, in the grave
next to Mr. Lewes. In sleet and snow, on a bitter
day&mdash;the 29th December&mdash;very many whom she
knew, very many whom she did not know, pressed
to her grave-side with tributes of tears and flowers.</p>

<p>Her spirit joined that choir invisible "whose
music is the gladness of the world."</p></blockquote>

This was a visit to Six-Mile Bottom, where M. Turguenieff,
who was a very highly valued friend of Mr. and Mrs. Lewes, had
come to compare his experiences of Russian and English sport.
I remember George Eliot telling me that she had never met any
literary man whose society she enjoyed so thoroughly and so unrestrainedly
as she did that of M. Turguenieff. They had innumerable
bonds of sympathy.</p></div>

"George Henry Lewes Studentship."&mdash;This studentship has
been founded in memory of Mr. George Henry Lewes, for the
purpose of enabling the holder for the time being to devote himself
wholly to the prosecution of original research in physiology.
The studentship, the value of which is slightly under £200 per
annum, paid quarterly in advance, is tenable for three years, during
which time the student is required to carry on, under the
guidance of a director, physiological investigations, to the complete
exclusion of all other professional occupations. No person
will be elected as a "George Henry Lewes Student" who does
not satisfy the trustees and director, first, as to the promise of
success in physiological inquiry; and, second, as to the need of
pecuniary assistance. Otherwise all persons of both sexes are eligible.
Applications, together with such information concerning
ability and circumstances as the candidate may think proper,
should be sent to the present director, Dr. Michael Foster, New
Museums, Cambridge, not later than October 15, 1879. The appointment
will be made and duly advertised as soon as possible
after that date.</p></div>
